Some real and unreal enumerative geometry
 
Frank Sottile

 The geometric counterpart of looking for real solutions to a system of
polynomial equations is real enumerative geometry, which addresses the
following question of Fulton: "How many solutions to a problem of
enumerative geometry can be real, when that problem is one of counting
geometric figures of some kind having specified position with respect to
some general fixed figures".  Quite surprisingly, in every known case it is
possible to have all solutions be real.  Such an enumerative problem is
called fully real.  Recent progress has been stimulated by a remarkable 
conjecture of Shapiro and Shapiro, which is false in its original generality,
but in a very interesting way.


   This talk will discuss some fully real enumerative problems, the
conjecture of Shapiro and Shapiro, and recent progress.  The main goal 
will be to describe refinements and extensions of the conjecture of 
Shapiro and Shapiro, which are supported both by extensive experimental
evidence, and some theorems.  In particular, we will describe a family of
`fully unreal' enumerative problems for which it is possible to have *no*
real solutions.
