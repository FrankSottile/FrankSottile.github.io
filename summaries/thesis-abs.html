<H2>"Real enumerative geometry for the Grassmannian of lines in
projective space", 1994 PhD thesis of Frank Sottile:</H2> 
<H3>Abstract:</H3>
<P>
Enumerative geometry was originally concerned with determining the
number of real objects satisfying  independent conditions.  
Geometers swiftly realized that complex geometry provides the most
elegant setting for the resolution of such  questions. 
We  extend the classical Schubert calculus of enumerative geometry for the 
Grassmannian of lines in projective space
from the complex  realm back to the real.   


<P>
The primary tool we use in establishing our results
is an adaptation of the `principle of degeneration' from classical
enumerative geometry. 
Classical geometers solved enumerative problems by specializing
the conditions so  that the number of 
figures satisfying the degenerate conditions could be readily
determined. 
Then they argued that this number was
indeed the correct number for generic conditions.
Enumerative problems are not generally amenable to a direct
application of this principle; geometers typically use it to determine
the Chow ring, and then solve enumerative problems using the Chow ring.
