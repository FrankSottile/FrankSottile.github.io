  Generalized witness sets

    The fundamental data structure in numerical algebraic
 geometry is that of a witness set, which is considered
 to be an instantiation of Weil's notion of a generic
 point.  Reinterpreting a witness set in terms of duality
 of the intersection pairing in intersection theory leads
 to a generalization of the notion that makes sense on
 many spaces and leads to a general notion of a witness set.

   This notion is most productive for homogenous spaces, such
 as projective spaces, Grassmannians, and their products.
 After exlaining the general theory, I will sketch what                                                            
 this means for the Grassmannian.
