<P>
In this talk, I will report on the following joint work with Nantel Bergeron
of York University:

<P>
We give the formula for the multiplication of an arbitrary Schubert 
class in the cohomology of a symplectic flag manifold by a special
Schubert class pulled back from the Lagrangian Grassmannian.   This
formula is expressed in both terms of chains in the Bruhat order, and 
in terms of the cycle structure a certain permutations, showing it to
be a common generalization of the Pieri-type formula for the Lagrangian 
Grassmannian and that for the ordinary flag manifold.   Our proof uses
results on the Bruhat order, identities of structure constants and 
intersections of Schubert varieties.
