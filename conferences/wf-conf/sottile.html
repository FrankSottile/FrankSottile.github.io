  Fulton asked how many solutions to a problem of enumerative
geometry can be real, when that problem is one of counting geometric figures
of some kind having specified position with respect to some general fixed
figures.  For the problem of plane conics tangent to five general conics,
the (surprising) answer is that all 3264 may be real.  Such questions arise
also in applications; recently, Dietmaier has shown that all 40 positions of
the Stewart platform in robotics may be real.

  The purpose of this talk is to describe a general method for constructing
real solutions to some enumerative problems.
This method is based upon homotopy continuation algorithms and is an analog
of Viro's method, or toric deformations.
We describe how this method may be used to show that some classical problems
in enumerative geometry may have all their solutions be real,
and apply it to give a classical problem for which we may have no real
solutions.
Extensive computer experimentation leads to intriguing conjectures on the
general situation for many such Schubert-type enumerative problems.
