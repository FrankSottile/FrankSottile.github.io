Toric polar Cremona transformations

  Frank Sottile

   Garcia and Sottile showed that problem of
classifying toric patches that posses linear
precision is equivalent to a classifying
homogeneous polynomials whose toric derivatives
(which generate its toric polar linear system)
define a Cremona transformation (a birational
isomorphism).

  In this talk, I will explain the motivation
from geometric modelling and then outline the
classification of forms F in three variables
whose toric derivatives define a Cremona
transformation, which solves an open question
in geometric modeling.   This is joint work with
Kristian Ranestad and Hans-Christian Graf
von Bothmer.
