   Homework will be collected at least on Thursdays;
    at times there will be some problems due on Tuesday, which Frank will
    grade.

  A few of the problems will be corrected and graded each week.

  the assigned problems. 
  Your score will be based partially upon completing all assigned problems and partially

  computing your grade.</FONT>
