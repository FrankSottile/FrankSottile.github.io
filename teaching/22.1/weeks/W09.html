You do need to finish your <a href="../Second_paper.html">Second Paper </a> this week.
<!-------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------->
I will be putting up information about your term paper soon.
Rough instructions are:
This should be about 2500-3000 words, or a comparable project in another medium.
The topic is your choice, but (like the book) it should involve a nontrivial amount of history and a nontrivial amount of mathematics.
Note that contemporary topics are OK.
If you already have ideas, or want to discuss this, feel free to write me on Piazza.

<font color=maroon><h3>Week 9: 19 March 2022. </h3></font>
<ul>
  <li><font color=maroon><B>Opening Remarks:</b></font><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This week's reading is first on mechanics, which is an important influence of physics on Mathematics.
  As an algebraist, physics major, and now applied mathemetician, I appreciate these topics.
  This is slightly out of place, as it predates and motivates the Calculus, but then it continues quite a bit past the time of calculus.
  Stillwell probably did not want to split this into two chapter, hence the slight mismatch.
  At any given time, mathematics is being developed along several fronts, and thus a subject-based historical survey
  will have to jumo around in time a lot.
<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; The chapter on mechanics covers a lot of history, from the late medieval period until 1900.
  This begins with relations between velocity, acceleration, and distance, and ends with
  chaotic motion and fluid mechanics.
  I suspect that the compression of topics is due to Stilwell's interests, and probably also the need to keep the book from getting too long.

<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  I am also assigning reading about differential geometry and curvature, but not yet assigning many homework problems from it.
This topic naturally follows mechanics and mechanical curves.

  <li><font color=maroon><B>Reading:</b></font>
   <ul>

    <li>
     Chapter 13 in Stillwell's book.   Pages 262&ndash;263 are a bit cumbersome, and Fulling has a succinct and easy summary
     of <a href="../../18.1/pdfs/wave.pdf">d'Alembert's derivation of the wave equation</a>.
    </li> 
    <li>Watch the Vsauce videa on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skvnj67YGmw">Brachistochrome</a>.
    </li> 
    <li>
      Watch the 3Blue1Brown video
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cld0p3a43fU">interviewing Steven Strogartz about the Brachistochrome</a>.
   </li> 
   <li>
    Chapter 17 in Stillwell's book.
    While differential geometry is a 19th century topic, this can be read just after Chapter 13 (next week, we do the three in between).
    </li> 
    <li>Watch the Numberphile video about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-TBlh44gY">curvature and eating Pizza</a>.</li>
    <li>Read the following Here is a <a href="../../18.1/pdfs/partial_derivatives.pdf">handout</a> I created for a course in
      differential equations at the University of Toronto, when the students needed a proof that mixed partials derivatives commuted.
      It, like the differential equations course I had in 1982 at Michigan State was proof-based (the instructor gave careful proofs
      of all results, including existence and uniqueness of solutions to ordinary differential equations.
   </ul>
  </li>

  <li><font color=maroon><b>Assignment:</b></font> Due Monday, <font color=red>28 March 2022</font>. (HW 9)<br>
        Here is a <a href="../HW/HW09.pdf">.pdf</a> and a  <a href="../HW/HW09.tex">LaTeX source</a> of the assignment.<br>
   <b><font color=maroon>To hand in:</font></b>  <font color=red>We are using Gradescope
     for homework submission</font>.
  <ol>
    <li>Exercises 13.5.1 and 13.5.2.</li>
    <li>Do the steps in Fulling's explanation of <a href="../../18.1/pdfs/wave.pdf">d'Alembert's  derivation of the wave equation</a>.
    <li>With your second paper coming due, I will not assign  problems from Chapter 17, for now.</li>

    <li>Do the three problems in the <a href="../../18.1/pdfs/partial_derivatives.pdf">handout</a> on Clairaut's Theorem about
      mixed partial derivatives.
