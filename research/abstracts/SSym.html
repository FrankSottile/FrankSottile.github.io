 We analyze the structure of the Malvenuto-Reutenauer
 Hopf algebra of permutations in detail.
 We give explicit formulas for its antipode, prove that it is a cofree
 coalgebra,  determine its  primitive elements and its coradical filtration,
 and show that it decomposes  as a crossed product over the Hopf algebra of
 quasi-symmetric functions. In addition, we describe the structure
 constants of the multiplication as a certain number of facets of the
 permutahedron.
 As a consequence we obtain a new interpretation of the product of
 monomial quasi-symmetric functions in terms of the facial structure of the
 cube.
 The Hopf algebra of Malvenuto and Reutenauer has a
 liniear basis  indexed by permutations. Our results are obtained from a
 combinatorial description of the Hopf algebraic structure with respect to a new
 basis for this algebra, related to the original one via
 M&ouml;bius inversion on the weak order on the symmetric groups.
 This is in analogy with the relationship between the monomial and fundamental
 bases of the algebra of quasi-symmetric functions.
 Our results reveal a close relationship between the structure of the
 Malvenuto-Reutenauer Hopf algebra and the weak order on the symmetric groups.
