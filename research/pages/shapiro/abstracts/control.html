<H2>Some remarks on real and complex output
    feedback
</H2>


<P>
     We provide some new necessary and sufficient conditions which guarantee
arbitrary pole placement of a particular linear system over the complex
numbers.  We also exhibit a non-trivial real linear system which is not
controllable by real static output feedback and discuss a conjecture from
algebraic geometry concerning the existence of real linear systems for which
all static feedback laws are real. 
     <P>
    For an amplification of our example of a non-trivial real linear system
    which is not controllable with real output feedback, a further
    discussion of computational issues, and the MAPLE/SINGULAR scripts we
    used, click <A HREF="http://www.nd.edu/~rosen/pole/index.html">here</A>.
