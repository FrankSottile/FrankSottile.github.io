<p><b>Abstract:</b> 

In 1988 Brion gave a formula for the integer points in
a rational polytope in <b>R</b><sup><i>d</I></sup> in terms of certain rational 
generating functions associated to its vertices.  His proof 
used the equivariant <i>K</i>-theory of singular toric varieties, 
and  his formula led to Barvinok's polynomial-time algorithm
for the integer points in a polytope.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   I will present a proof of Brion's Theorem based on simple 
counting, using the technique of irrational decompositions.
This is joint work with Beck and Haase.  I will also describe 
how Koeppe uses irrational decompositions to dramatically 
improve the performance of Barvinok's algorithm.
