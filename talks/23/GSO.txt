Galois groups in Enumerative Geometry
 
    In 1870 Jordan explained how Galois theory can be applied
 to problems from enumerative geometry, with the group encoding
 intrinsic structure of the problem.  Earlier Hermite showed
 the equivalence of Galois groups with geometric monodromy
 groups, and in 1979 Harris initiated the modern study of
 Galois groups of enumerative problems.  He posited that 
 a Galois group should be `as large as possible' in that it
 will be the largest group preserving internal symmetry in 
 the geometric problem.

   I will describe this background and give some concrete
 examples of some geometric problems with interesting Galois groups.
