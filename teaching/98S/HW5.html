A <I>Young tableau</I> of size <I>n</I> is an arrangement of the integers
1,2,...,<I>n</I>  in a left-justified array, like a Ferres diagram, but with
numbers instead of boxes or dots.
For exampe, here are some Young Tableaux of size 6:

<BR> How many <FONT COLOR=FF0000>ordered</FONT>
pairs (<I>P,Q</I>) of Young tableaux of size 4  
<FONT COLOR=FF0000>(with <I>P</I> and <I>Q</I> having the 
same shape)</FONT>
are there?
(Here, <I>P</I> and <I>Q</I> are Young tableaux of size 4.)
<BR>

<FONT COLOR=FF0000>What is the number of pairs of size 5?</FONT>

<LI>
Show that if a graph has 10 vertices and at least 37 edges, it must be
connected. 
<BR>

Is there a graph with 10 vertices and 36 edges which is disconected?

<LI>
Exhibit isomorphisms between the following graphs:

<LI>
<B>Section 1.1</B> # 13.

<LI>Show that on any graph, at least two vertices have the same degree.

<LI>
(RATHER HARD!) <FONT COLOR=FF0000>Due April 2.</FONT>
Which of the following graphs are isomorphic and which are not?
For the isomorpic pairs, exhibit a matching giving the isomorphism
(Use the labeling indicated in graph A).
For non-isomorphic graphs, give a reason. (Note: it suffices to do this
for one graph in each isomorphism class.)
