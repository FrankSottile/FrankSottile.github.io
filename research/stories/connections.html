Mathematics often provides the proper level of abstraction, enabling the
researcher to see and exploit hidden connections between disparate problems in
different subjects.
For example, consider the classical geometric problem:
How many lines meet 4 lines in space?
The picture at right illustrates the solution: there are two such lines.
(The given lines are in <font color=blue>blue</font>, the solution lines
in <font color=green>green</font>, and the saddle surface is an auxiliary
construction that helps solve the problem.)

Understanding generalizations of this problem continues to be important in
mathematics.
(<A href="http://www.math.tamu.edu/~sottile/conferences/MSC02/index.html">Link</A>
 to a recent scientific meeting in this subject.)
&nbsp;Interestingly, solutions to this very problem arise in other subjects, often in
a disguised form:

<OL>
<LI> The <font color=green>feedback laws</font> solving a problem of
   controlling a <font color=blue>particular system</font> in electrical
    engineering, 
<LI> the <font color=green>rational functions</font> having prescribed
  <font color=blue>critical points</font>, &nbsp; and
<LI> <font color=green>indeterminate lines of sight</font> to objects whose
   edges include the <font color=blue>four lines</font>.
</OL>
This last example is the most direct; it is precisely along the 
<font color=green>solution lines</font> that the <font color=blue>four
lines</font> outlining the objects appear to coincide.
