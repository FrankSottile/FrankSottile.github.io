Frontiers of realityin Schubert calculus

Frank Sottile

Algebraic Geometry Seminar
Texas A&M University
1 December 2008

   This talk is a warm up for an invited talk 
that I will give in the Current Events Bulletin
at the AMS national meeting in January 2009.



   The Shapiro conjecture for Grassmannians (now a
Theorem of Mukhin, Tarasov, and Varchenko) asserts 
that all (a priori complex-number) solutions to 
certain geometric problems from the Schubert calculus 
are actually real.  Their proof is quite remarkable, 
using ideas from integrable systems and representation
theory.    Despite these advances, the full Shapiro 
conjecture remains open with several interesting and 
not quite understood generalizations that are likely true.

    This talk will introduce the Shapiro conjecture
for Grassmannians and its links to subjects from 
combinatorics to complex analysis to control theory and 
then give an idea of its proofs and consequences, and 
its extensions.
