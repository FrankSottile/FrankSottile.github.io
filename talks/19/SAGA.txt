Some algebraic geometry in applications

Frank Sottile

Algebraic geometry is the study of sets which arise as 
the common zeroes to a collection of polynomials.  It 
is a deep and powerful subject, combining geometric     
intuition with algebraic precision.   It is also increasingly
a useful tool in applications of mathematics, for 
whenever polynomials arise, the methods of algebraic
geometry may be brought to bear on the problem at hand.

I will illustrate this growing trend through a series 
of interrelated examples of algebraic geometry
arising in applications.
