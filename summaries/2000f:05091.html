Let $\scr S\sb \infty$ be the infinite symmetric group consisting of
permutations of $\{1,2,\cdots\}$ which fix all but finitely many
numbers. Let $\germ S\sb u$ be a Schubert polynomial indexed by a permutation
$u$ of $\scr S\sb \infty$. It is an open problem to understand the
multiplicative structure constants for the Schubert polynomials. The
structure constants $c\sp w\sb {uv}$ defined by the identity
$\germ S\sb u\germ S\sb v=\sum\sb {w\in\scr S\sb \infty}c\sp w\sb {uv}\germ
S\sb w$ are
positive integers. But a combinatorial construction for the $c\sp w\sb {uv}$
is not known. Let $S\sb \lambda(x\sb 1,x\sb 2,\cdots,x\sb k)$ be a Schur
polynomial indexed by a partition $\lambda$ of $n$. Then there is a
unique Grassmannian permutation $v(\lambda,k)$ such that the Schubert
polynomial $\germ S\sb {v(\lambda,k)}$ is equal to the Schur polynomial
$S\sb \lambda(x\sb 1,x\sb 2,\cdots,x\sb k)$. In the paper under review, the
authors show that structure constants for the multiplication of
Schubert polynomials by Schur symmetric polynomials are related to the
enumeration of chains in a new partial order on $\scr S\sb \infty$, the
Grassmannian Bruhat order. They present a monoid $\scr M$ that
describes the chain structure of this order and show that $\scr M$ is
analogous to the nil-Coxeter monoid $\scr N$ for the weak order on
$\scr S\sb \infty$. Here the monoid $\scr M$ plays a role in studying
reduced sequences. Furthermore, a description of the constant
$c\sp w\sb {uv(\lambda,k)}$ using the elements of $\scr M$ is given.

The authors give a series of interesting open questions about the
Grassmannian Bruhat order.<P><P>
