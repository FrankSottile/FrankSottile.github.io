In the paper <font color="AA00FF">The Envelope of
       Lines Meeting a Fixed Line and Tangent to Two Spheres</font>, we study
the set of lines meeting a fixed line that are also tangent to two spheres.
Our goal is to completely classify possible configurations of one lines and
three spheres that have infinitely lines meeting the fixed line that are also
tangent to the spheres.

<A NAME="Thm1"></A>
<P>
<B>Theorem 1.</B>
 Let <i>l</i> be a line and 
 <I>S</i><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>S</i><SUB>2</SUB>, <I>S</i><SUB>3</SUB> be three
 spheres in <B>R</B><SUP>3</SUP>.
 Then there are infinitely many lines that meet <i>l</i> and are 
 tangent to each sphere in precisely the following cases:
 <TABLE>
  <TR valign=top>
   <TD>(i)</TD>
   <TD> The spheres are tangent to each other at the same point 
	and either <i>l</i> meets that point, 
        or it lies in the common tangent plane, or both. 
        The common tangent lines are the lines in the tangent plane
        meeting the point of tangency.
   </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR valign=top>
   <TD>(ii)</TD>
   <TD> The spheres are tangent to a cone whose apex lies on <i>l</i>.
        The common tangent lines are the ruling of the cone.
   </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR valign=top>
   <TD>(iii)</TD>
   <TD> The spheres meet in a common circle and the line
        <I>l</I> lies in the plane of that circle.
        The common tangents are the lines in that plane tangent to the
        circle.
   </TD>
  </TR>
  <TR valign=top>
   <TD>(iv)</TD>
   <TD> The centres of the spheres lie on a line <I>m</I>
        and <I>l</I> is tangent to all three spheres.
        The common tangent lines are one ruling on the hyperboloid of
        revolution obtained by rotating <i>l</i> about <I>m</I>. 
   </TD>
  </TR>
 </TABLE>

<P>

We illustrate the configurations of the Theorem.
In (i), the three spheres are mutually tangent at the some point, so that the set
of lines in the common <font color="00FF88">tangent plane</font> through the
point are tangent to all three spheres. 
Then the <font color="FF00FF">line</font> either passes through the common 
<font color="00FF88">tangent plane</font> (on  the left) or it lies in the
common <font color="00FF88">tangent plane</font> (on the right), or 
both.

In (ii), there is a <font color="00FF88">cone</font> that is tangent to the
three spheres, and the <font color="FF00FF">line</font> meets the apex of the
<font color="00FF88">cone</font>.
<CENTER>
 <IMG SRC="cone.gif">
</CENTER>

The last two cases are illustrated below.
In (iii) (on the left) the three spheres meet in a <font
color="0000FF">circle</font>, and the <font color="AA00AA">line</font> lies in
the <font color="00FF88">plane</font> of that 
<font color="0000FF">circle</font>. 
In (iv) (on the right), the <font color="AA00AA">line</font> is tangent to the
three <font color=red>spheres</font>, and their centres lie on a common 
<font color=blue>axis</font>.  The <font color="00FF88">common tangents</font> 
form the <font color="00FF88">hyperboloid</font> of revolution obtained by
rotating the <font color="AA00AA">line</font> about the 
<font color=blue>axis</font>.

In general, the set of lines that meet a fixed <font color="AA00AA">line</font>
and are tangent to two <font color=red>spheres</font> determines the spheres.
This set is an algebraic curve of lines (of degree 8), and the union of the
lines is a <font color="00FF88">ruled surface</font> (of degree 8) tangent to
the  <font color=red>spheres</font>.
We call this ruled surface the <B><font color="00FF88">envelope</font></B>.
When <font color="AA00AA">line</font> and <font color=red>spheres</font> are in
general position, this is irreducible and it determines the 
<font color=red>spheres</font>.
Here are two pictures illustrating the <font color="00FF88">envelope</font>.

When the <font color=red>spheres</font> and <font color="AA00AA">line</font>
are in special position, the <font color="00FF88">envelope</font> becomes
reducible.
Besides the cases illustrated in <A HREF="#Thm1">Theorem 1</A> above, the most
interesting cases is when there is a <font color="00FF88">component</font> of
degree 4.
If this occurs, then there are two possible geometries:
Either the <font color=red>spheres</font> are symmetric about the 
<font color="AA00AA">line</font> (on the left below), or they are both tangent
to the <font color="AA00AA">line</font> at the same point (on the right below).
Neither configuration admits a third spheres tangent to all the lines.

The hardest part of the proof that limits a quartic 
<font color="00FF88">envelope</font> to the two cases above
is when there is a rules quartic surface of lines that meet a fixed 
<font color="AA00AA">line</font>  and are tangent to a 
<font color=red>sphere</font>, and the points of
tangency form a <font color=blue>conic</font> on the
<font color=red>sphere</font>.
In this case, there cannot be a second sphere.
Here is a picture.
