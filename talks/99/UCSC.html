   In 1981, Brockett and Byrnes showed how the static feedback laws which
control a given linear system are determined through the Schubert calculus
of enumerative geometry.  This talk will describe that connection and
propose numerical homotopy methods to solve the resulting systems of
polynomial equations.

<P>
  The related questions of finding real feedback laws and of trying to 
do Schubert's calculus over the real numbers are intertwined with
a precise conjecture of Shapiro and Shapiro.  We discuss a new result which
shows it is possible to do Schubert's calculus over the real numbers and 
proves a  version of this conjecture.  In a similar vein, problems of 
enumerating rational curves in the Grassmannian (also known as quantum 
enumerative geometry) may also be solved over the real numbers.
