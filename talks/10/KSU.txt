An Experimental Road to Mathematical Truth

While the use of computers is fundamental to 
much mathematical work in applications, in 
pure mathematics computers are often confined 
to small scale verification of conjectures 
or routine computations embedded in a proof.

  I will give a brief discussion of computer 
use on a completely different scale that led 
to the formulation and testing of conjectures 
in geometry whose partial resolution has 
attracted much attention.
