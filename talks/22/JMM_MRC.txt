Algebraic Varieties at Infinity

  Algebraic geometry has long been interested in the behavior at infinity
of solutions to polynomial equations or varieties.  It is known that asymptotically,
the structure of a variety is governed by its tropical variety, and object from
geometric combinatorics.  This in turn leads to natural compactifications, complete
with coordinate charts in which to study these points at infinity.  My talk will
give a sketch of this technology suitable for a general audience.
