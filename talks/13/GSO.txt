Numerical analysis is the future of computation in algebraic geometry

   The ability to represent and manipulate objects in algebraic
geometry on a computer has had a great effect on the subject.
The current dominant paradigm is symbolic computation using
exact arithmetic.  Current and likely future trends in computer 
technology will lead to a diminished role for symbolic
computation, which is not parallelizable, and an increased role
for parallelizable numerical computation.

   My talk will discuss computation in algebraic geometry,
both symbolic and numeric.  After an overview which includes the
role of parallelism in symbolic and numeric computation for 
algebraic geometry, I will discuss some of the basics of 
numerical computation in algebraic geometry, and explain 
how working towards this numerical future fits into the
research of those with whom I work.
