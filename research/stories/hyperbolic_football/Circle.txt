Notes on "hyperbolic footballs" for the Math Circle

2 Septeber 2012.
  I worked with Sam and Maria.  In 25 minutes,
Maria: Cut out two sheets and put in 3 heptagons
Sam:   Cut out one sheet (I provided one) and put in 3 heptagons

Lesson:  Precut sheets, one per student

Need: more straightedges and pencils (for Phil).

Did the hyperbolic football activity with the younger math circle.

Useful: Lots of extra cut-out hexagon patterns, and more than a few
  heptagons.  If someone messes up their pattern, just give them 
  a pre-cut one.

Next time: 
 -Need 2-3 assistants.  Need to train them.
 -Emphasize from the very beginning that the model is not flat.
 -Emphasize that the tape is to be put on the back (unlined) side.
 -For taping, emphasize that you tape edge-to-edge.  When doing a heptagon,
   start with one edge, then do an adjacent edge, making sure to 
   spread the hexagon out so that the shapes are edge-to-edge.

 When they start their cutting, make it extremely clear that they should 
  do a very careful job.  This is a precision model, and carefully cutting 
  is helpful to make an attractive model.
     
Order of action
 (1) Tape one heptgon into one hexagon template
 (2) Cut our two additional pieces of paper
 (3) Assemble the hexagon templates together, but only at the centre.
--> Snack break
 (4) Begin to put in the heptagons.
 (5) Last 1/2 hour:  Discuss parallels and triangles
