 Begin with a rational normal curve in 3-space, and  
 select three points on it.
 Consider the three tangent lines at those points.

 The lines meeting these three  lines form a ruling of the quadric (here a hyperboloid 
 of one sheet) through the three lines.
 Each intersection of this hyperboloid with a fourth line gives a line meeting
 all four.
 In this geometric context, the Shapiro conjecture is 
equivalent to the following geometric statement<BR>
<CENTER>
  <font color=red>
   Any line tangent to the rational normal curve at a real point meets the
 hyperboloid in two real points.</font>
</CENTER>

 It is not hard to believe this, as the rational normal curve loops around
 the hyperboloid.<BR>
