Item #4: Employment Survey: Part III

Among the 89 responses I received there was a wealth of comments that
people had.  This article contains many of the comments from the graduate
students who responded to the survey.  Every comment is anonymous, and I
have made some effort into breaking the comments into basic groups.

The first set of responses are those discussing the failures and successes
of the job market.  That is, comments about the job market not operating as
we hope it might, or comments showing that in some cases, the market does
seem to work in the way that we would like it to.

The second set of responses contains comments containing basic information
on what worked or didn't work for individuals on the market, and what the
responder felt turned out to be an important consideration that helped get
them or their friends hired.

I have a few observations based on reading the comments, the first of which
is that there is quite a lot of disillusionment with the system.  This is
not really surprising considering that all of the respondents had just
spent the last 6 months going through the grueling experience of hunting
for a job.  I am also pleased to see the number of people who are willing
to offer their insights on the job market.

Based on the latter set of comments, something that I think everyone should
be aware of is that what works for students at one school may not work at
other for students from other schools.  Moreover, how one school hires will
have very little to do with how another school hires.  These differences
even occur among schools where you would least expect it.  This is why I
feel that it helps to have a large number of data points when examining the
process that schools go through in looking to fill a position.

Now to the responses:

Responses on failures (and successes) of the job market.
=================

 I'm glad that someone is taking the time to find out just where things
stand this year so far; I'd be curious to know what the projected unemployment
rate will be and if there's any short-term help on the way from the AMS or
some other such body....otherwise, there'll be one major waste of talent and
experience sweeping the nation next year.

==================

I felt that the employers had made up their minds before the interviews.
The interview seemed to be a confirmation of their decisions and a sales pitch.

====================

I never heard back from the other place that phone-interviewed me. I have not
heard up or down from a number of other places that I sent applications to.
I haven't heard OF anybody who has heard from anyone either. Nobody seems to
know what the correct time table is, or anything! I *started* applying in
mid-January. I stopped applying in Mid-March. I got the job I accepted *solely*
through _my_, not my advisor's contacts, even though my advisor is _very_
famous. I wish there were guidelines on how one gets one's advisor involved, or
whether one should get him/her involved.

======================

The other two places at which I had interviews did not bother to
contact me at all after the interview, even some time after the
job had been accepted by someone else. I had to call them back and
ask, which I thought was a bit inappropriate. Then I just got the
form letter rejection, too ("due to the large number of highly qualified
applicants", etc.).

==========================

"short lists" which didn't amount to anything.  The numbers of people on these
 short lists were 40, 40, 16, 5, 10, and an undetermined number.  I landed
the job because someone there works in my area.

===========================

   The offer I received was contingent on my beginning work immediately.
    Although this was not at all convenient, due to the status of my
    thesis work, I did not feel that I had any bargaining power. So far
    I am happy with the job, but at this point it does not appear that
    my doctoral work is going to be of any particular benefit, aside from
    the general skills I obtained by associating with and observing  a
    diverse group of brilliant individuals. As far as the pay, I am making
    5K less than I was before I started my PhD!!

    At this point, I truly wish that I had never begun a Ph.D. program.

===========================

        I have been told repeatedly by a variety of people that being a
        white male is not to my advantage.

===========================

    Industry is not much better than academia, especially with large companies
    (the kind with research labs) still refusing to hire until they fully
    recover from the recession, and especially if you're limiting yourself
    to a particular metropolitan area (two-body problem).  I plan to submit
    an article to YMN when/if I land a position, sharing my experiences and
    strategies.  All I can say is that I'd hate to be a _pure_ mathematician
    trying to convince some corporation I'm worth hiring...!

===========================

       One short anecdote. I applied to a medium-sized research school
        where one of the (I think influential) faculty knew who I was. He
        told me that my file looked good, but that the school had
        decided, due to the horrible job market, to open up its
        post-doctoral positions to people several years past the Ph. D.,
        that is, people who were beyond the post-doc stage. Since someone
        with 0 years of experience cannot really compete with someone
        with 3-4-5 years of experience, he told me it was very unlikely I
        would get a job there. He was right.

===========================

        I was pleasantly surprised that the system sometimes actually
works.  I was not offered the job because of any connections that I or
my advisor had.  The position advertised was for somebody in my field
(one of the very few that specifically mentioned my field) and I
applied.  There were two people called for an interview, they made
me an offer, and I accepted within the two weeks they allowed for my
decision.  I feel very lucky.

======================

 I had a two body problem, and ended up turning my offers down to
        stay at my graduate institution in a one-yearpart-time
        teaching position.  This may sound bad but it was the best
        compromise I could make considering all I was trying to
        balance.

=======================

 After working hard and trying to use every possible angle or connection I
could think of to get the best job.  The job I ended up accepting was one where
I had none of these, although the other two offers I received came as a result
of playing all of the angles.  It makes you wonder if all of the time and effort
was really beneficial.

===========================
===========================

Comments and Suggestions on job hunting.
----------------------------------------

I had delayed graduation 1 year after not receiving an offer the first time
around.

All of the people who got jobs of any kind, including postdocs or temporary
positions, were known as fantastic teachers.  One or two outstanding
researchers, who didn't happen to have teaching awards,  were passed over
entirely.  It seems that teaching counts for a great deal in hiring for any
type of position that a new PhD is likely to get.

======================

I must differ with the opinion I've seen expressed that one should send
a small number of carefully written applications, rather than wallpapering
America with one's cv. That philosophy assumes one has a good way of
generating the right short list of schools. Had I restricted myself to
my 20 favorite schools when I applied, I probably would not have applied
to the place that hired me this year. However, now that I've done more
research I can see that really my new job is a better place for me than most
of my old favorites. So the reasons for sending a ton of applications
aren't all cynical.

=======================

        I got the one offer I did because of a (semi) personal connection,
        i.e., my advisor knew someone on the faculty. I have had no
        indication whatsoever (with one or two exceptions) that any of
        the other schools even looked at my application.  I would be very
        interested to hear of people who got their positions simply by
        applying, i.e., they (or their advisor) did not know anyone at
        the hiring institution. I am trying to determine the utility of
        applying to schools where you have no connection to anyone.

======================

 The one thing that really seemed to make a (positive) difference
      for me was that I have far more teaching experience than most
      grad students.  I have been developing/using various "reform"
      materials and techniques.  This provided a topic of common
      interest when talking informally with faculty where I
      interviewed.

===========================

 My experiences indicate to me the importance of a carefully written cover
letter, and the usefulness of the ER.  Of the 14 schools to which I applied, I
was on the short list at 4, and invited to on-site interviews at 3.  All three
of these were schools I interviewed with at the ER.  One of the schools I
turned down told me that I was their first choice.  They wound up being my
second choice.  This was a position that I would not have applied for had I
not gone through the ER.  By the time I accepted a position, several of the
places I where I had applied had not even started looking at applications, so
I can't say what might have happened with them.  However, several people
mentioned that my cover letter was one of the main reasons I wound up under
consideration.  For what it's worth to others, here's what I think I did
differently from some of my peers (at least at the school I graduated from):
I only applied to a select few schools where there seemed to be a particularly
good match.  I specifically stated why I thought I would be suitable for the
position advertised, i.e., I mentioned things that they had listed as desired
in the ad, that I could satisfy.  I also mentioned any features of the school,
department or position that I felt were particularly attractive to me.  Before
I wrote my letters, I researched each department as carefully as I could,
using college catalogs, e-mailing colleagues, talking with anyone I could find
who had graduated from the school, etc.  This took a good deal of
time--several hours for each school, at least, and many hours for my top four
choices--which is one reason why I applied to only 14 schools, but it also
helped me eliminate many positions from my consideration.

Incidentally, despite the horror stories I have read in recent years, EVERY
school to which I applied kept me informed as to the status of their search,
and whether I was still under consideration, and EVERY one of them sent me a
letter when the search was concluded, letting me know that they had filled the
position (even though I sent a letter to all of them asking to be removed from
consideration after I accepted a position).  I don't know whether this
indicates an improvement over previous years, or is simply a reflection of my
attempt to choose schools with a supportive atmosphere, but it was heartening
to see.  Kudos to all the search committees that took the time to do things
right!
