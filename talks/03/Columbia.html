  Real algebraic geometry is a difficult subject.  Basic questions 
about some of the most elementary objects may not have answers that
seem satisfactory when compared to the answers obtained in classical 
algebraic geometry.  Nevertheless, it is a well-developed subject and
an important one as applications demand real solutions.  There are also
many hidden gems in the subject.

<P> &nbsp; &nbsp;
  This talk will try to illustrate these remarks in a corner of the 
subject that I know well---real linear series on
  <b>P</b><sup><small>1</small></sup>.  
For a preview
of some of the talk, below are pictures of linear series on
  <b>P</b><sup><small>1</small></sup>
 of dimension 3 and degree 4 with simple real ramification.
