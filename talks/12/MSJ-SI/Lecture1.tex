\DeCo{{\LARGE Experimentation in the Schubert Calculus}}
\end{center}

The Schubert calculus provides a rich and well-structured family of problems in enumerative
geometry which may be used as a laboratory for exploring ill-understood phenomena,
as it is very easy to model moderate-sized Schubert problems on a computer.

These lectures will discuss two such phenomena: reality of solutions to systems of
equations from geometry and Galois groups of enumerative problems.

We will discuss a number of proofs, many conjectures, and hints of additional structure
that can be seen in data which has been amassed through massive (several tera Hertz years)
computations exploring these phenomena.

\RawSienna{{\LARGE Wronskian and the MTV Theorem}}
\end{center}

\noindent
The Wronskian of polynomials $f_1,\dotsc,f_m\in\C[t]$ is
\[
   \DeCo{\Wr}\ :=\ 
   \det\ \left(\begin{matrix}
        f_1(t) &f_2(t)&\dotsb &f_m(t) \\
        f'_1(t) &f'_2(t)&\dotsb &f'_m(t) \\
         \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
     f^{(m-1)}_1(t) &f^{(m-1)}_2(t)&\dotsb &f^{(m-1)}_m(t) 
    \end{matrix}\right)\ .
\]
When $\deg(f_i)=m{+}p{-}1$, $\deg(Wr)=mp$.
Moreover, up to  scalar, $\Wr$ depends only on the linear span \DeCo{$P$} of the $f_i$,
and only finitely many spans $P$ have a given Wronskian.\vspace{-5pt}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\noindent\Purple{Theorem.} \Brown{(Mukhin, Tarasov, Varchenko)}
{\sl
 If $\Wr(P)$ has only real roots, then $P$ has a basis of real polynomials.\vspace{-5pt}
}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Those spans $P$ with a given Wronskian are the solutions to a system of polynomial
equations, so this is an example of a system of equations with \DeCo{{\sl only}} real solutions.

\RawSienna{{\LARGE Polynomial systems with only real solutions}}
\end{center}


\noindent
Among the roots of a real univariate polynomial $f$, some are real and the rest occur in 
complex-conjugate pairs.

\noindent
Rarely are all roots of $f$  real.


\noindent
A primary example that comes to mind is when $f$ is the characteristic polynomial of a
real symmetric matrix, which only has real eigenvalues.


\noindent
Similarly, a first example of a system of multivariate polynomials with only real
solutions is the system for the eigenvalues/eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix.

\noindent 
It will turn out that this  elementary fact from linear algebra is behind the 
unexpected reality of the MTV Theorem, whose proof I will sketch.

\RawSienna{{\LARGE Numerical accident ?}}
\end{center}

\noindent
The proof begins with a numerical accident.

\noindent
In 1884, Schubert (essentially) determined that 
\[
\# \Wr^{-1}(F(t))\ =\  
          \dfrac{(mp)!\,0!1!2!\dotsb {m-1}!}{p!(p{+}1)!\dotsb (p{+}m{-}1)!}\,.
\]
Call this number \DeCo{$\deg(m,p)$}.

\noindent
This number is also the dimension of the space of invariants
\[
\deg(m,p)\ \stackrel{!}{=}\ \dim \left(\left(\C^m\right)^{\otimes mp}\right)^{{\mathfrak sl}_{m}\C}\ .
\]

\noindent
Strengthening this coincidence is at the heart of our story.

\noindent
For $i=1,\dotsc,m$ let \DeCo{$y_i(t)$} be a polynomial of degree $ip$.
Define the \DeCo{master function}\vspace{-10pt}
\[
  \DeCo{\Phi}\ :=\ 
   \displaystyle \prod_{i=1}^m \mbox{\sf Discr}(y_i) \Bigg/
   \displaystyle \prod_{i=1}^{m-1} \mbox{\sf Res}(y_{i},y_{i+1})\ ,  \vspace{-10pt}
\]
where \DeCo{$\mbox{\sf Discr}$} and \DeCo{$\mbox{\sf Res}$} are the classical discriminant
and resultant.\vspace{-5pt}

\noindent
Writing $\Phi$ in terms of the roots $s_{i,j}$ of $y_i$ gives,  \vspace{-5pt}
\[
  \Phi(s)\ =\ \prod_{i=1}^m\prod_{j\neq k}(s_{i,j}-s_{i,k})^{\Red{2}} \cdot
           \prod_{i=1}^{m-1}\prod_{j, k}(s_{i,j}-s_{i+1,k})^{\Red{-1}}\ . \vspace{-5pt}
\]
(The exponents come from the Cartan matrix of type $A$.)

\noindent
Remarkably, \Magenta{$\deg(m,p)$} counts the (orbits of) critical points of $\Phi(s)$.

{\sl
   Let $\bx$ be a critical point of the master function $\Phi_\bs$.\vspace{-17pt}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $\beta(\bx,\bs)$ is well-defined, non-zero, and a joint eigenvector of 
         the Gaudin Hamiltonians.
  \item $\beta(\bx,\bs)$ is a $\mathfrak{sl}_{m}\C$-invariant.
  \item When $\bs$ is general, the vectors $\beta(\bx,\bs)$ for $\bx$ a critical point
    form a basis of $\bigl(V^{\otimes mp}\bigr)^{\mathfrak{sl}_{m}\C}$.
  \item When $\bs$ is general, the Gaudin Hamiltonians have simple spectrum.
  \item The eigenvalues \DeCo{$\lambda_i(t)$} of $K_i(t)$ on $\beta(\bx,\bs)$
    satisfy\vspace{-12pt}

\noindent
Usual Euclidean inner product on $V$ induces the 
\DeCo{Shapovalov form} on $V^{\otimes mp}$, which is 
$\mathfrak{sl}_{m}\C$-invariant.

\noindent
Gaudin Hamiltonians are symmetric w.r.t~the Shapovalov form.

\noindent
Therefore, when $\bs$ and $t$ are real, their eigenvalues $\lambda_i(t)$ on a vector
$\beta(\bx,\bs)$ for a critical point $\bx$ are real.

\noindent
Then the fundamental differential operator is real, and thus its kernel $V_\bx$ is also
real. 

\noindent
This implies the MTV Reality Theorem, as spaces $V_\bx$ for $\bx$ a critical point give all
spaces of polynomials whose Wronskian has roots $\bs$.
