Some algebraic geometry in applications

Algebraic geometry  is the  study of  sets which  arise as  the common
zeroes to  a collection  of polynomials.   It is  a deep  and powerful
subject, combining geometric intuition with algebraic precision.  With
many vivid examples, algebraic geometry  is also quite accessible.  It
is also increasingly a useful tool in applications of mathematics, for
whenever polynomials arise,  the methods of algebraic  geometry may be
brought to bear on the problem at hand.

This  talk will  illustrate that  growing  trend through  a series  of
elementary and interrelated examples  of algebraic geometry arising in
applications.
