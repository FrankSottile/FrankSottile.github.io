<P>

 We give a presentation for the (integral) torus-equivariant Chow ring of the
 quot scheme, a smooth compactification of the space of rational curves of
 degree $d$ in the Grassmannian.
 For this presentation, we refine Evain's extension of the method of
 Goresky, Kottwitz, and MacPherson
 to express the torus-equivariant Chow ring in terms of the torus-fixed points and 
 explicit relations coming from the geometry of families of torus-invariant curves.
 As part of this calculation, we give a complete description of the
 torus-invariant curves on the quot scheme and show that each family is a 
 product of projective spaces.
