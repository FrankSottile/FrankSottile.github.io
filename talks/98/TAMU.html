<P>
An important problem in mathematics is to find or understand the solutions
to a system of multivariate polynomials.
The best understanding is obtained when working over the complex numbers,
and the situation is more difficult for real solutions.
Despite this difficulty, applications demand that we look for real
solutions.
In this talk, I will report on such work on a specific class of polynomial
systems.
This is an example of a task we often face---working to bridge the gap
between powerful general results and specific assertions needed in
applications. 



<P>
The Schubert calculus of enumerative geometry studies the following
polynomial system (expressed geometrically):
Given linear subspaces 
<I>K<SUB>1</SUB> , ... , K<SUB>n</SUB></I> of an 
(<I>m+p</I>)-dimensional space with
dim<I>K<SUB>i</SUB> =m+1-a<SUB>i</SUB></I> and 
<I>a<SUB>1</SUB> + ... + a<SUB>n</SUB> = mp</I>, 
determine the <I>p</I>-planes <I>H</I>
with <I>H</I>\cap <I>K<SUB>i</SUB> </I>\neq {0}   for each <I>i</I>.
Hilbert's 15th problem, now solved, asked for a rigorous justification of
Schubert's determination of the number of complex solutions.
I will discuss concrete aspects of this; the existence of real solutions,
numerical algorithms for finding the solutions, and applications of the
understanding gained.
