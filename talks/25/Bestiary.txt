A Bestiary of Bloch Varieties

To a  Z^d-periodic weighted graph with  vertices V, we may  associated a
periodic graph operator  that acts on l_2(V).   After Floquet transform,
we obtain its  Bloch variety, which is an algebraic  hypersurface in T^d
\times  R  whose projection  to  R  is  the  spectrum of  the  operator.
Features  on Bloch  varieties such  as Dirac  (double) points,  critical
points,  and  their  level   sets  (Fermi  varieties)  reflect  spectral
properties of the operator.

With  students Faust  and Robinison,  and using  the Brazos  cluster, we
investigated  many   thousands  of  small  periodic   graphs,  recording
invariants and  features of  their Bloch anf  Fermi varieties.   In this
talk, I will briefly discuss the background and present some examples of
interesting behavior of Bloch varieties that we uncovered.
