<!--In Sphereland, if shapes must be regular, what are the possible shapes ? (Look up Platonic, or regular solids.) In that case, is it possible for the number of sides to increase with each generation ? What do you think happens ? Write a couple of paragraphs about this and your explorations.-->

    <font color="AA0022"><b>Extra Credit:</b></font> Each of the passwords used for zoom in this class has numerological significance.
    I will give extra credit (added to test scores) of 5, 10, and 20 points for the answers to their numerological significance.
    (5 for the first one answered, 10 for the second, and 20 for the third.  I think that their difficulty is at least in  geometric
    progression.)
    The answers must be posted in Piazza and in reply to the post I will put there, and must not be anonymous.
    The tradition that evolved of anonymous posting is a bit of a pity.
