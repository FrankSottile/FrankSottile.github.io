Polytopes and Polynomial Systems
Frank Sottile
4 April

   The exponent of a monomial involving n variables is an integer
vector in Z^n.   The set of exponents in a polynomial in n variables
is its support, and their convex hull is its Newton polytope.
Many questions and answers concerning zeroes of multivariate 
polynomials are best expressed in terms of the discrete structures
of support and Newton polytope.  The same is true for algorithms
and constructions involving multivariate polynomials.

  In this talk for a general audience I will explain some of this 
relation between polynomials and polytopes, and give examples of 
how these structures are used to answer questions involving zeroes 
of multivariate polynomials.
