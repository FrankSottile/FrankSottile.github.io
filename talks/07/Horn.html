   Work of  Klyachko and  of Knutson and  Tao in  the 1990's
established  the  Horn conjecture,  which  is a  recursively
defined set  of inequalities among  eigenvalues of hermitian
matrices A,  B, and  A+B.  This used  representation theory,
Schubert calculus, and combinatorics.  A consequence is that
other problems in mathematics have a similar Horn recursion,
for example when is a Littlewood-Richardson number non-zero?
Its geometric  counterpart is to determine  when a triple of
Schubert  varieties  in   a  Grassmannian  must  meet.   The
partition indices of such  a triple of Schubert varieties is
called a feasible triple.

<p>  &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  The answer is that a triple is feasible if and only if the
three partitions  satisfy Horn inequalities  parametrized by
all feasible  triples for smaller  Grassmannians.  In brief,
the Schubert  calculus on  a Grassmannian is  controlled (to
some  degree)  by  the  Schubert  calculus  on  all  smaller
Grassmannians.

<p>  &nbsp; &nbsp; 
   In  this  talk,  I  will  begin by  discussing  the  Horn
inequalities for eigenvalues of hermitian matrices A, B, and
A+B, and what  they mean for geometry.  Then  I will discuss
Belkale's  geometric  proof  of  the Horn  recursion.   This
suggests that perhaps  other related feasibility problems in
Schubert calculus have a similar recursive description.  The
last  part of  my talk  will describe  a Horn  recursion for
other  problems  in  the  Schubert calculus,  discovered  in
collaboration  with  Kevin  Purbhoo  of  the  University  of
British Columbia.
