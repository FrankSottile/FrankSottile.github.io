<H2>Case  <I>m,p</I>=4,2</H2>


This is the first case where evidence for Shapro's conjecture was found by
Rosenthal and Sottile [<a href="Bib.html">RS</a>] (A
<a href="http://www.nd.edu/~rosen/pole/index.html">description</A> of the
computations.) 
It is hard to express how astounding it was to see that the choices in
Conjecture 1 seemed to give only real solutions after doing many more
general computations.
<P>

To test Conjecture 1 in these cases, we need only use a MapleV.5 script,
which you can 
<A HREF="42.instances">view</A>.
This script generates an instance, computes a degree reverse lexicographic
Gr&ouml;bner basis, and then uses
the FGLM conversion algorithm to compute the eliminant, and then finally
checks to see if all the roots are real.
If not, it prints an error message.
Some procedures to do the FGLM conversion are contained in another Maple
script, 
<A HREF="MakeLex">MakeLex</A>.


<P>
We use local coordinates which reduce the number of parameters by 2.
While this complicates the first degree reverse lexicographic Gr&ouml;bner
basis (Strange, that fewer variables slow the computation!), it greatly
expediates the computation of the eliminant.
