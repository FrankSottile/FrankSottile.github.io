<font size=+3><b>The Computational Procedure</b></font> <hr>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;  
In this project we investigate millions of instances of
different enumerative problems on various classical flag varieties.
The choice of which enumerative problems to study is not the subject
of this page, but rather how the computations for a single enumerative
problem are performed.

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;  
For a given enumerative problem, there is a text file, called
<tt>Enumerative_Problem.data</tt>, which contains the <a href='data.html'>data</a>
defining the problem to be studied. An example of this file can be found
<a href='exampledata.txt'>here</a>.  These data include: 
<ul>
 
<li>A  compact description  of the  <a href='data.html#ep'>enumerative
problem</a>.</li>
 
<li>Elapsed <a href='data.html#time'>time</a> of the computation.</li>

<li>Average <a href='data.html#size'>size</a> of the eliminant.</li>

<li>The number of complex <a href='data.html#sol'>solutions</a> to the
enumerative problem.</li>

<li>A list of  the <a href='data.html#neck'>necklaces</a> which encode
the combinatorial type of the order along the rational normal curve at
which the conditions are evaluated.</li>

<li>A list, <i>X</i>,  of the <a href='data.html#pts'>points</a> where
the conditions will be evaluated.  </li>

<li>Most importantly,  a <a href='data.html#table'>table</a> recording
the observed  frequencies of the  possible numbers of  real solutions,
for each necklace.</li>

</ul>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;  
This data  file is formatted  to be read  by Maple, which  uses the
data  to   create  a  Singular   input  file  that  controls   the  
first  stage</a>  of  the  computation.   In  this stage, a subset of 
the points <i>X</i> is selected randomly, then each
necklace determines  which Schubert conditions are  evaluated at which
osculating  flags.    Each  such  choice  is  one   instance  of  the
enumerative problem.  Each instance is formulated as the solutions to
a  system  of  polynomial   equations.  
These systems are passed to Singular which uses  Gr&ouml;bner basis methods
to compute an eliminant (a  univariate polynomial in the ideal of the enumerative 
problem) for each instance.
In the second phase of the computation, these eliminants are passed to Maple
which computes the number of real roots of each eliminant using the 
package <tt>realroot</tt>, and the table is updated accordingly.

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;  
The number of real roots of each eliminant equals the number of real solutions
to the corresponding instance of the enumerative problem,
only eliminants satisfying the Shape Lemma are passed to Maple.
That is, when Singular computes an eliminant, it checks whether its
number of roots equals the number of solutions to the enumerative problem.
If not, then it computes a different eliminant.
In fact, it does the following.
It first computes an eliminant with respect to one variable,
and if this fails, then it applies a random linear shear to that variable and
computes a new eliminant.
If this fails, then it does this procedure again, with respect to a different
variable.
If this fails for each variable, an eliminant is computed with respect to a
random linear form.  
If no eliminant satisfying the shape lemma is found, then an error message is
printed to a file <tt>BadIdeals</tt>, and this instance of the enumerative
problem is studied by hand.  

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;  
One iteration  of the procedure just described  yields one instance
of  the   enumerative  problem   for  each  necklace.    The  complete
computation is organized by a shell script which iterates this procedure 
a fixed number  of times (typically  several hundred to several  tens of
thousands), randomly selecting  a new set of points <i>X</i> each time.
