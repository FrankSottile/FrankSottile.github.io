  Grothendieck polynomials were introduced by Lascoux and
Schutzenberger as polynomial representatives of classes of Schubert
structure sheaves in the Grothendieck ring of a flag variety.  They
are of considerable interest combinatorially as they are a natural
generalization of Schubert polynomials.  In this talk, I will discuss
some formulas involving Grothendieck polynomials.  These include (1) a
Pieri-type formula for the multiplication of an arbitrary Grothendieck
polynomial by one representing the structure sheaf of a special
Schubert variety, and (2) a formula for expressing a Grothendieck
polynomial as a sum of Grothendieck polynomials evaluated at subsets
of the variables, where the coefficients are Schubert structure
constants.

  This second formula involves permutation patterns and leads to a new
construction of Grothendieck polynomials in terms of chains in the
Bruhat order (easily seen to be equivalent to the standard formula
in terms of rc-graphs.)  It may be used to show that every Buch-Fulton
quiver coefficient is, in a natural way, equal to a Schubert structure
constant.
