Toric ideals, real toric varieties, and the moment map</H2>

Frank Sottile
     <P>
      This is a tutorial on some aspects of toric varieties related to their
 potential use in geometric modeling.
 We discuss projective toric varieties and their ideals, as well as real
 toric varieties and the moment map.
 In particular, we explain the relation between linear precision and the moment
 map. 
 This builds on the introduction to toric varieties by David Cox:
