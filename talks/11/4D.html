      While we are all familiar with regular polygons
   (equilateral triangles, squares, ...), and 
   many of us know about the Platonic, or regular
   solids (tetrahedron, cube, octahedron,....),
   few are familiar with their analogs in dimensions
   four and higher.  Of course, this is because
   we are not equipped to perceive four-dimensional
   space directly.<br>

   &nbsp; &nbsp;
      Nevertheless, the description of the regular
   solids in all dimensions has been known for a long 
   time.  The purpose of my talk will be to introduce
   you to these objects, with an emphasis on how to
   think about them.   This presentation will
   be spiced up with some models of four-dimensional
   regular solids, some of which you can build yourself.
