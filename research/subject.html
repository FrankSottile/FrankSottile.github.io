<P>
The core of my work concerns various aspects of the Schubert calculus, 
which was my original interest.
Over time, these interests have broadened somewhat.

A rough classification of my work breaks it into either 
<A HREF="subject/Combinatorics.html">combinatorics</A> or 
<A HREF="subject/Geometry.html">geometry</A>.

A finer classification is 
<A HREF="subject/Schubert.html">Schubert calculus</A>, 
<A HREF="subject/Hopf.html">Combinatorial Hopf Algebras</A>, 
<A HREF="subject/Real.html">Real Algebraic Geometry</A>,
<A HREF="subject/CAG.html">Computational Algebraic Geometry</A>,
<A HREF="subject/AAG.html">Applicable Algebraic Geometry</A>,
and 
<A HREF="subject/CG.html">Computational Geometry</A>.

<!-- <P>
Here is a collection of surveys I have written.-->
