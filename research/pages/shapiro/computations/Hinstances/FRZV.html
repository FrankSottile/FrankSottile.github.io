Most exciting of all these computations are symbolic
computations of Faug&egrave;re, Rouillier, and
Zimmermann and the numerical computations of Verschelde.

My (Sottile's) recent interest in this conjecture was spurred by the
communication of the computation of an instance of 
<I>m,p</I>=4,3 of Faug&egrave;re, Rouillier, and
Zimmermann.

They first used FGB to calculate a degree reverse
lexicographic Gr&ouml;bner basis for the polynomial system
of Conjecture 1  for <I>m,p</I>=3,4 with 
<I>s</I><SUB>i</SUB>=<I>i</I>. 
This yielded a Gr&ouml;bner basis of size 32M.
They then computed a rational univariate 
representation (a sophisticated substitute for an
eliminant) in two ways.
Once using a multi-modular implementation of the
FGLM algorithm and a second time using RS, 
an improvement of the RealSolving
software under development.
The eliminant had degree 462 and size 3M, thus its general
coefficient had 2,000 digits.
Using an early implementation of Uspensky's algorithm, they
verified that all 
of its zeroes were real, establishing an instance of 
Conjecture 1 for <I>m,p</I>=3,4. 
In the course of this calculation, they found it necessary
to rewrite their software.
<P>

Also notable is the case <I>m,p</I>=8,2 (also one instance each of 7,2 and 4,3)
computed by Jan Verschelde 
[<A HREF="../../Bib.html#verschelde">V</A>] using his
implementation of the SAGBI homotopy algorithm in 
[<A HREF="../../Bib.html">HSS</A>].
Since the polynomial system of Conjecture 1 was
ill-conditioned, he instead used the equivalent system of
Conjecture 1 described <A HREF="../../SectII.4.html">previously</A>
where the rational normal curve is paramerteised by Chebyshev polynomials. 
These numerical calculations give approximate
solutions whose condition numbers determine a neighborhood
containing a solution.
The solutions of this real system are stable under complex 
conjugation, so it sufficed to check that each neighbourhood and its complex
conjugate were disjoint from all other neighborhoods.
This computation took approximately 25 hours on a 166MHz Pentium II
processor with 64M running Linux.
These algorithms are `embarrassingly parallelizable', and
in principle they can be used to check far larger polynomial systems.
