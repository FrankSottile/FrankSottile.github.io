Directions from I-91.

Coming from I-91, take Amherst Exit (Route 9 East)

Follow this across the Connecticut River, and then a few iles until you
get to an area with a small mall and some strip malls.

Leave Rte 9 at 116 (North).   This becomes an expressway for about 1 mile,
and you take the exit for U Mass.   


  The road you get off on is called Massachusetts Avenue,
and you take the first possible left (at a light) from it.
This will be where the campus begins, and you  follow that
road until the first light - with a modern athletic center 
on the left and old farm buildings on the right.
This road takes you to the parking garage for the Campus Center.  
Park anywhere in it.    The VDMD is in Room 1634 of 
Lederle Graduate research Tower.  You will see 3 tall buildings 
when you leave the Garage. The Library is reddish and to the
 south, while the campus center and Lederle are cement 
(grey/tan).  The tallest of the two cement buildings
is Lederle.  (Rooom 1634 has the best view on campus)
