<H2>Structure of the Loday-Ronco Hopf Algebra of Tres</H2>

<P>

 Loday and Ronco defined an interesting  Hopf algebra structure on the linear
 span of the set of planar binary trees.
 They  showed that the inclusion of the Hopf algebra of non-commutative
 symmetric functions in the Malvenuto-Reutenauer Hopf
 algebra of permutations factors through their Hopf algebra of trees, and these
 maps correspond to natural maps from the weak order on the symmetric group to
 the Tamari order on planar binary trees to the boolean algebra.
<P>
 We further study the structure of this Hopf algebra of trees using a
 new basis for it.
 We describe the product, coproduct, and antipode in terms of this basis
 and use these results to elucidate its Hopf-algebraic structure.
 We also obtain a transparent proof of its isomorphism with the
 non-commutative Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of Foissy,
 and show that this algebra is related to non-commutative symmetric functions as
 the (commutative) Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra is related to symmetric
 functions.
