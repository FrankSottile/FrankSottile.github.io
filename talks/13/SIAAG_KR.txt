The Khovanskii-Rolle Algorithm

   Over 30 years ago, Askold Khovanskii used a multivariate generalization
of Rolle's Theorem to give a bound on the number of positive solutions to 
a system of polynomial equations that depends only on the number of terms 
appearing in the equations, and not on their degree.   Reflecting this 
dependence, this class of bounds are called fewnomial bounds.   Khovanskii's
proof was revisited by Bihan and Sottile, who gave a refined bound that is 
asymptotically sharp, in a certain sense.   Subsequently, it was observed
that Khovanskii's use of Rolle's Theorem can form the basis of a continuation 
algorithm for numerically computing the real solutions to a system of 
fewnomials.   This Khovanskii-Rolle algorithm finds the real solutions 
by following real arcs, and avoids computing complex solutions to the 
fewnomial system.  Consequently its complexity depends upon the fewnomial
bound and not on the number of complex solutions.

   This talk will explain this Khovanskii-Rolle algorithm and describe
some technical challenges that are encountered in its implementation.
This represents joint work with Dan Bates and Matt Niemerg.
