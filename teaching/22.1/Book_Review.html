<font color=maroon><h2>The book review (due 10 February 2022) </h2></font>
<br>
  You will need to both email a .pdf to me at <TT><a href="mailto:sottile@tamu.edu">sottile@tamu.edu</a></TT>,
  as well as to turnitin.com. 
Here is the information for our class:<br>
<font color=magenta>Math 629 History of Mathematics &nbsp; &nbsp; Class ID: 33187690&nbsp; &nbsp; Class Enrollment Key:
  Sottile629</font><br> 
Please make your review double-spaced (actually 1.3 or 1.5 will do), also 12 pt type for
  my old eyes, and a running head with your name and finally, page numbers.  Thanks.
<br>

Your first paper is a review of a book that contains both 
<b>a nontrivial amount of history and a nontrivial amount of mathematics</b>.<br>
Note that a book review is not a paper on the book, or even just a summaary.  I encourage you to look up some
reviews of books (not on-line reviews, but those published in newspapers and magazines) to help you gain an idea of what
constitutes a review.

<br>
There are many (perhaps too many) possibilities.
This could be, for example
<ul>
  <li> a biography of a mathematician, such as <br>
   S. Nasar, <i>A Beautiful Mind:  Biography of John Nash, Jr</i>, or <br>
   S. Batterson,  <i>Stephen Smale</i>.
  </li>

  <li> a memoir or autobiography, such as <br>
   G.H. Hardy, <i>A Mathematician's Apology</i>, or <br>
   P. Halmos, <i>I Want to be a Mathematician</i>.
  </li>

  <li> a history of a branch of mathematics, such as <br>
    Carl Boyer, <i>The History of Calculus and its Conceptual Development</i>.
  </li>

  <li> a history of a particular period of mathematics, such as <br>
     Frank J. Swetz, <i>Capitalism and Arithmetic: The new math of the 15<sup>th</sup> Century</i>, or<br>
     J.L. Berggren, <i>Episodes in the Mathematics of Medieval Islam</i>.
  </li>

  <li> a story of a particular mathematical development, such as <br>
       David Bressoud, <i>Proofs and Confirmations: the story of the alternating sign matrix conjecture</i>, or <br>
       J.W. Dauben, <i>Abraham Robinson;  the creation of non-standard analysis, a personal and mathematical odyssey</i>.
    </li>

  <li> Liping Ma's book "Knowing and Teaching Elementary Mathematics".   This is profoundly interesting.</li>
  
  <li> <a href="Book_Review_old.html">Books my students reviewed in the past</a></li>
</ul>

This is by no means exhaustive, even of the types of books that are available.
I just went through the list of books in my library and picked out a few (of about 50 on history and
biography) that are representative.  
I have read all of these sometime in the past 35 years.

 More extensive lists appear on the course pages of my predecessors, 
<ul>
  <li> The Mathematical association of America has an extensive list of  <a href="https://www.maa.org/press/maa-reviews/browse">reviews of
         mathematics books</a>.  
         This is pretty comprehensive.  Some are appropriate for this class, and some are not (e.g. most textbooks).
         Still, there is a lot there.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://calclab.math.tamu.edu/~fulling/m629/bookrevu.html">S. Fulling</a>  (this page is based on his)
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://distance-ed.math.tamu.edu/math629_10C/bookreport.htm">G. D. Allen</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.math.tamu.edu/%7Egeller/math629/bookreportf05.html">S. Geller</a>
  </li>
</ul>

I would prefer that you each choose different books.
I am keeping track of this on my <a href="Book_Review_old.html">page</a>.<br>
A list of specialty online bookstores is on Fulling's 
<a href="http://calclab.math.tamu.edu/%7Efulling/m629/links.html">Links</a> page.<br>
Some of these books may be available from a local library or through other electronic resources.

<!--------------------------------------------->
<hr>
<!--------------------------------------------->

Please let me know via Piazza which book you plan to review.
We can also discuss this.
Get to this soon, as I would prefer people to each choose different books, and your favourite might get selected.<br><br>

Further:

<ul>
  <li>
    The books listed above on the pages of my predecessors vary in level, including level of scholarship and mathematical maturity required.
  </li>
  <li>
    Most of you are teachers or parents or both.  If you read a book 
   intended for a popular or juvenile audience, write your review from the 
    perspective "I do/don't recommend this book for students at level X."
  </li>

  <li>  Several of the biograpies contain references that delve into 
      the mathematics at a  more technical level (for example, the subject's actual research papers).
     Maybe you could follow up some of those leads.
  </li>

  <li>The review is due 10 February 2022, it is to be at least 1000 words long, and will be handed in both to turnitin.com, as well as
      emailed to me: <TT><a href="mailto:sottile@tamu.edu">sottile@tamu.edu</TT></a>.<br>
  I will mark it both for content and for quality of writing, but more the first than the second.
  </li>
</ul>
