  I expect to work on reading, marking, and returning them while I am on another
  mathematics trip to Seoul, Korea, where I attend a <a href="http://home.kias.re.kr/MKG/h/MirrorSymmetry17/">conference</a> and work with
  collaborators.<br>

  &nbsp; &nbsp;
  In your readings of Stillwell, I'd like it if you could include reading the exercises, as well as the text.
  I have come to realize that Stillwell puts some useful historical and mathematical gems in his exercises, and
  that we all have something to learn from thinking about them.
  Several good texts/reference works employ this trick of including additional material in the exercises.
  <br>

  &nbsp; &nbsp;
  The historical notes at the end of the chapter provide some interesting color about the lives of the protagaonists; they are likewise worth reading.
  <br>

  &nbsp; &nbsp;
  This week's readings and exercises are all about solving equations, which has been one of the main uses of mathematics since antiquity.
  Of particular note was the early Renaissance explosion in what is now Northern Italy that led to solutions to the cubic and quartic equations
  in the space of just few years&ndash;this was the first advance in this topic in nearly a millenium, as well as the last for about 250 years.
  It also led to the modern understanding of and comfort with the exotic negative and complex numbers.  <br>

  &nbsp; &nbsp;
  It is in part because of these (and many other) advances in our ability to give/find/approximate/compute solutions to systems of equations, and the
  appearence of this in the mathematics cirriculum that a common view of a mathematician is "someone who solves equations all day".
  Of course, this is not the main task of mathematicians, neither academic nor those working in the private sector nor those teaching.
  For me, however, solving equations is a significant part of my research.
  I sometimes start a professional talk with the comment that I am the only person in the room who does what their mother thinks they do.
  Silliness aside, solving equations is important and serious business; we have seen a lot of this so far in our study of the history of mathematics;
  many surviving pieces of mathematics are aids to calculation, or devoted to methods to solve equations and obtain numerical answers.

  <li><font color=maroon><B>Reading:</b></font>  
  <ul>
    <li> Stillwell Chapter 6.
         As mentioned above, please read the exercises, as well as the historical notes at the end of the chapter.
    </li>
    
     <li> Read the St. Andrew's page on
      <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Quadratic_etc_equations.html">Quadratic, cubic and quartic equations</a>.
     </li>

    <li> Read the St. Andrew's page on
       <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/HistTopics/Tartaglia_v_Cardan.html">Tartaglia vs. Cardano</a>.  This is some of their
       correspondence.  An interesting read.
    </li> 
     
     <li> I have a <a href="pdfs/cubic.pdf">short text</a> that is a transcription of a <a href="https://www.mathcircles.org/">math circle</a> that I
     have given (including Saturday, 18 February at the
     <a href="http://www.torontomathcircles.ca/home.html">Fields Institute's math circle</a>) on solving the cubic.
          This works reasonably well with students who have had algebra (so they are familiar with the quadratic formula).

   </ul>
  </li>

   <!-- <li>Exercises 6.3.5 and 6.3.6 in Stillwell.  For 6.3.5, you may need to rely a bit upon the previous exercises in 6.3.</font></li>-->
    <li>Exercises 6.5.2 and 6.5.3.   For 6.5.3, find the other two solutions (this will require reading my notes on cubics.)</li>
    <li>
    Here is another cubic to solve completely: <i>x</i><sup>3</sup>=7<i>x</i>+6, and another: <i>x</i><sup>3</sup>+2<i>x</i>+4<i>i</i>=0,
    where <i>i</i> is the imaginary unit, a square root of -1.  You will find the example on the bottom of page 3 of my notes, as well as
    the formula (-<i>i</i>)<sup>3</sup>=<i>i</i>, useful for the second cubic.
    </li> 
    <li>Do the exercises 6.7.1, 6.7.2, and 6.7.3 in Stillwell.  These should be relatively short.</li>
    <li>Cardano led an interesting life.  Look up some material on the web (two sources besides our book) and write something about his life, both
        mathematical and otherwise.  Probably two paragraphs, and try to include some story that is not in Stillwell's potted biography. </li>
