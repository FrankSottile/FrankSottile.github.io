<P>
   In 1981, Brockett and Byrnes showed how the feedback laws which control a
given linear system are determined through the Schubert calculus of
enumerative geometry.  This talk will describe that connection and propose
numerical homotopy methods to solve the resulting systems of polynomials.

<P>
   The related questions of finding real feedback laws and of trying to do
Schubert's calculus over the real numbers are intertwined with a precise
conjecture of Shapiro and Shapiro.  We will discuss this connection and
present some partial results and computational evidence in support of this
conjecture.
