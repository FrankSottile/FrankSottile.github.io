FrobAlg.py                 Robert's implementation of the Frobenius algorithm for studying a list of Schubert problems.
                            It is in Python2, runs Singular, and uses the Singular library schubert.lib.
			    It reads Schubert problems in a particular format, in schubertprob.txt
			    (This is formatted by the Python script prettyFormat.py from our Python library in the
			    checkerboard game, and the format is explained in FrobAlg.py).  For each, it runs the Frobenius
			    algorithm, determining if it is the full symmetric group, or if it cannot tell.
			    This uses Singular, using the library schubert.lib

                           With suitable modification, it can be used to test other lists of Schubert problems.
			    
schubertprob.txt           This contains the initial list of Schubert problems to be tested.

schubert.lib               Singular library for computing Schubert problems.

Full_Symmetric_Group.txt   These are the Schubert problems that it found has full symmetric Galois groups
Unknown_Galois_Group.txt   These are the Schubert problems that is could not tell if they had full symmetric Galois groups
schubert_template.sing     This is a template file.  It should not be altered.

SchubertStats.py           This takes a lies of Schubert problems in Unknown_Galois_Group.txt and computes 50,000 Frobenius
                           elements for the problem, writing the output to a text file Schubert_Stats.txt that, for each
			   Schubert problem in Unknown_Galois_Group.txt contains both a plain text frequency table of
			   the cycle types found, as well as a formatted LaTeX table.

                           It uses both schubert.lib and cycle_sample.sing
cycle_sample.sing          This is a template file.  It should not be altered.  It could be deleted.
Schubert_Stats.txt         The output from SchubertStats.py

Simplify.py                This Python 3 script reads Schubert_Stats.txt and writes just the lines with the
                            Schubert problems and ASCII frequency table to the file Raw_data.txt
Raw_data.txt               The output file

mkHtml.py                  A Python3 script that reads Raw_data.txt and writes it into a .html file Frobenius_Raw.html.
                            It needs the file procedures.py
procedures.py              Procedures for mkHtml.py

Frobenius_Raw.html         The raw data in .html format.  This requires .gif files of Young tableaux, which is available
                            in the .tarball Tableaux.tar
           
Tableaux.tar               All the tableaux for Frobenius_Raw.html
