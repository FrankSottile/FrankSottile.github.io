<P>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
 We give a bound for the number of real solutions to systems of <i>n</i>
 polynomials in <i>n</i> 
 variables, where the monomials appearing in different polynomials are distinct.
 This bound is smaller than the fewnomial bound if this structure of
 the polynomials is not taken into account.
