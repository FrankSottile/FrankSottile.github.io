       The Galois group of a problem in enumerative geometry encodes the
       structure of the set of solutions.
       This invariant was introduced by Jordan in 1870, and shown by Harris 
       in 1979 to be a monodromy group of the total space of the problem.
       That is, it is the group of permutations of solutions obtained by
       varying the conditions.
       For example, in the animation at left the two magenta lines are
       interchanged when the black line rotates, showing that the Galois group
       of the Schubert problem of 4 lines is the full symmetric group,
       <I>S</I><SUB>2</SUB>.

      <br>
       Numerical homotopy continuation, a method to compute numerical
       solutions to systems of equations, was developed for applications of
       mathematics. 
       With Anton Leykin, we apply it to the problem from pure mathematics of
       computing Galois groups of 
       <I><font color=blue>Schubert problems</font></I>, a 
       class of geometric problems including the problem of four lines.

       In this talk, I will describe this work, also giving the necessary
       background.
       In particular, I will explain how we show by direct
       computation that the Galois group of the Schubert problem
       of 3-planes in 8-dimensional complex space meeting 15 fixed 5-planes
       non-trivially is the full symmetric group S<SUB>6006</SUB>.
