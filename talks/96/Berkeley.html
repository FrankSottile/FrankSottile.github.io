<P>
The Schubert calculus, a basic tool in enumerative geometry, gives 
algorithms for solving certain problems of 
enumerating linear subspaces of projective space, such as:
How many planes in projective 5-space meet 9 given 
planes?<SUP>1</SUP>
Its core component is the intersection form, also known as the 
Littlewood-Richardson rule, for the cohomology (or Chow) ring of a 
Grassmann manifold in terms of its basis of Schubert classes.

<P>
An effective version of the Schubert calculus would, for example, 
explicitly find the 42 planes meeting 9 given planes in P<SUP>5</SUP>.
It may also explicitly describe how to deform
an intersection of two Schubert varieties into a sum of distinct 
Schubert varieties, that is, a geometric manifestation of the 
Littlewood-Richardson rule.


<P>
This talk will assume little prior knowledge, and could serve as an 
introduction to the geometry of Grassmann manifolds.
It will describe some results along these lines
and some of the geometry involved, including a weak solution to some 
problems 
like the 9 planes, and an effective version of Pieri's formula.
