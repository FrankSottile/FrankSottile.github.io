Discriminant Coamoebas in Dimension 2 via Homology

Coamoebas of reduced A-discriminants arise when studying the 
convergence of Mellin-Barnes integrals for the solutions to 
the associated A-hypergeometric system.  Nilsson and Passare
described these coamoebas, in dimension 2, as topological 
chains in the 2-torus T^2 with piecewise-linear boundary.  
This boundary, with opposite orientation, is the boundary 
of a natural centrally symmetric zonotope in T^2, and they 
showed that the union of these two chains is a cycle equal 
to vol(A)\cdot[T^2], i.e., it covers T^2 vol(A)-many times.  
Their proof could not be generalized to higher dimensions, 
and it gave no intuition about the multiplicity.

  In this talk, which is joint work with Passare, we give 
a new, simpler, and elementary proof of these facts which 
identifies the multiplicity from the pushforward of a 
homology cycle in a torus T^A to T^2.  The ingredients 
of this proof generalize to all dimensions, giving hope
for a complete understanding of A-discriminant coamoebas.
