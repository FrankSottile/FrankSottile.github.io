Summary: "We study when a problem in enumerative geometry may have
all of its solutions be real and show that many Schubert-type enumerative
problems on some flag manifolds can have all of their solutions
real. Our particular focus is to find how to use the knowledge that
one problem can have all its solutions to be real to deduce that
other, related problems do as well. The primary technique is to study
deformations of intersections of subvarieties into simple
cycles. These methods may also be used to give lower bounds on the
number of real solutions that are possible for a given enumerative
problem."
