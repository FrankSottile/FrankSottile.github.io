 Many aspects of Schubert calculus are easily modeled on a computer.
 This enables large-scale experimentation to
 investigate subtle and ill-understood phenomena in the Schubert calculus.
 A well-known web of conjectures and results in the real Schubert calculus has been
 inspired by this continuing experimentation.
 A similarly rich story concerning intrinsic structure, or Galois groups, of Schubert
 problems is also beginning to emerge from experimentation.   
 This showcases new possibilities for the use of computers as a tool in mathematical
 research.
