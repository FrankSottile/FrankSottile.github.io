   About 10 years ago, Boris Shapiro and Michael Shapiro
   made a remarkable conjecture about real solutions to 
   geometric problems coming from the classical Schubert calculus.
   While the conjecture remains open, there is truly overwhelming 
   computational evidence supporting it, and Eremenko and Gabrielov
   proved it for Grassmannians of 2-planes, where the conjecture is 
   the appealing statement that a rational function with only real 
   critical points must be real.
  <P>
   In my talk, I will introduce the Shapiro conjecture and discuss what we
   know about it.
   This includes a simple counterexample and a refinement which is
   supported by massive experimental evidence.
   This evidence includes tantalizing computations which suggest a
   strengthening: that a certain discriminant polynomial is a sum of
   squares, or more generally that it has such an algebraic
   certificate of positivity.
