To hand in: We are using Gradescope for homework submission.


\begin{enumerate}

\item  {[10]}
     Exercise 6.5.2 from Stillwell.

   \item  {[15]}
     Exercise  6.5.3 from Stillwell.
    Also find the other two solutions (this may require reading my notes on cubics.)

  \item  {[15]}
    Here is another cubic to solve completely: $x^3=7x+6$.

    
  \item  {[15]}
    Here is another cubic to solve completely: $x^3+2x+4i=0$, where $i=\sqrt{-1}$ is the imaginary unit, a square root
    of -1.
    You will find the example on the bottom of page 3 of my notes, as well as the formula $(-i)^3=i$ useful for this.

  \item  {[25]}
    Exercises 6.7.1, 6.7.2, and 6.7.3 in Stillwell. These should be relatively short.

  \item  {[20]}
    Cardano led an interesting life.
    Look up some material on the web (two sources besides our book) and write something about his life, both mathematical
    and otherwise.
    Probably two paragraphs, and try to include some story that is not in Stillwell's potted biography. 
\end{enumerate}
