Real algebraic geometry -- the geometry of varieties
defined by systems of real polynomial equations -- is a
classical subject presently encompassing many distinct
lines of inquiry.
This program will cover modern developments in
real algebraic geometry and its applications emphasizing topological
aspects of this subject and its relations to other fields of
mathematics.
These relations arise as real algebraic varieties appear naturally in
various mathematical contexts and, in particular, in applied mathematics,
and there continue to be important interactions withe these subjects.
(One  <A HREF="real_cubics.html">interaction</A> with solving equations.)

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
Besides the traditional directions of topological classification of
real algebraic varieties, we mean to focus on enumerative problems and 
relations to convex geometry via the theory of amoebas and tropical
geometry.
This will include  many recent and notable advances in real
algebraic geometry, as well as some of its most important
open problems.
Of particular emphasis will be the following topics.

<OL>
  <LI> Real algebraic curves.  (The pictures below are of two
              constructions of real plane curves exploiting convexity.)
       (An introduction to real algebraic curves  
        in <A HREF="real_curves.pdf">.pdf</A>.
 
  <LI> Real flexible (<I>J</I>-holomorphic) curves.
  <LI> Classification of higher-dimensional real algebriac varietites.
  <LI> Amoebas.  &nbsp;(<A HREF="viro.html">What is an Amoeba?</A>)
  <LI> Tropical algebraic geometry.
  <LI> Real Solutions to systems of equations. &nbsp;(A 
 <A HREF="http://www.math.tamu.edu/~sottile/pages/ERAG/index.html">survey</A>
 on geometric aspects of this subject.)

  <LI> Algorithms for real algebra via semi-definite programming.
  <LI> Real algebriac geometry in applications.
</OL>

The semester will include three week-long workshops:

<UL>
  <LI>
      <B>Introductory Workshop</B>.  &nbsp;
      
     This will introduce the main themes of the semester to the 
     mathematical public.  
     There will be three main series of lectures: "Topology
     and <I>M</I>-varieties", "Tropical algebraic geometry 
     and amoebas",  and "Enumerative problems and real
     solutions to equations", in additions to other survey talks
     by notable speakers. 
 
  <LI>
     <B>Workshop on the Topology and Geometry of Real Algebraic Varieties</B>.  &nbsp;

     This will concentrate on the most topological aspects of the
     subject, topics 1 -- 5 in the list above.

     

  <LI>
    <B>Algorithmic, Combinatorial, and Applicable Real
     Algebraic Geometry</B>.  &nbsp;

    This will concentrate on more constructive and algorithmic aspects of the
    subject, and feature applications to other fields,
    topics 6 -- 8 in the list above.
