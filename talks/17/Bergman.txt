The Bergman fan and the coamoeba of a linear space

The coamoeba of an algebraic subvariety of a complex torus is the
set of arguments of its points.  While this is an object from complex
analysis, it has surprisingly combinatorial structures coming from its
boundary, called the phase limit set.  We illustrate this in the
comaoeba and phase limit sets of a linear subspace, showing that its
dimension and boundary components may be described largely using the
Bergman fan of the corresponding matroid.   All terms will be described,
and some pictures will be shown.  This is joint work with Mounir Nisse.
