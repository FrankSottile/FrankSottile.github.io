In the context of the question posed by W. Fulton [Introduction to
intersection theory in algebraic geometry, Conf. Board Math. Sci., Washington,
DC, 1984; MR 85j:14008] about
how many solutions to a problem of enumerative geometry can be real,
the author of this paper pays attention to the problem of enumerating
parameterized rational curves in a Grassmannian satisfying codimension
1 conditions. He proves that the solutions to this problem may be all
real.
<P>
The interest of enumerating rational curves in Grassmannians comes
from mathematical physics [C. Vafa, in Essays on mirror manifolds,
96--119, Internat. Press, Hong Kong, 1992; MR 94c:81193; K. Intriligator,
Modern
Phys. Lett. A 6 (1991), no. 38, 3543--3556; MR 92k:81180] and it also
provides a meaningful number in systems
theory [M. S. Ravi, J. Rosenthal and X. A. Wang, Math. Ann. 311
(1998), no. 1, 11--26; MR 2000e:14095; SIAM J. Control Optim. 34 (1996),
no. 3, 813--832; MR 97c:93051]. The
question of real solutions also arises in this field [C. I. Byrnes, in
Three decades of mathematical system theory, 31--78, Lecture Notes in Control
and Inform. Sci., 135, Springer, Berlin, 1989; MR 90k:93001].
<P>
Taking into consideration the approaches for the complex case of
A. Bertram [Adv. Math. 128 (1997), no. 2, 289--305; MR 98j:14067], 
Rosenthal [SIAM J. Control Optim. 32 (1994),
no. 1, 279--296; MR 95b:93084], and the already cited research by
Ravi, Rosenthal and Wang, here, the existence of real solutions is
obtained by means of the equations for the locus of maps $M\colon {\bf
P}\sp 1\to G$ satisfying the required conditions. This also provides a
new and elementary proof for the computation of the total number of
solutions.<P><P>
