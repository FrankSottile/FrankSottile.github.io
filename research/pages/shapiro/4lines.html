The two lines meeting 4 lines in 3-space

<B>Meaning of Picture:</B>
This picture shows that given 4 general lines 
(<FONT COLOR=BLUE >3 blue</FONT> and one <FONT COLOR=FF00FF>maroon</FONT>)
in ordinary 3-space,
there will be two <FONT COLOR=FF0000>lines</FONT>  meeting all four.
<P>
One way to see this is to first consider the 
<FONT COLOR=BLUE >3 blue lines</FONT>.
If they are mutually skew, they will lie on a 
<FONT COLOR=EEBB00>hyperboloid of one sheet</FONT>.
On the 
<FONT COLOR=EEBB00>hyperboloid of one sheet</FONT>, 
there are two families of lines,
and each member of one family meets every member of the other family.
The <FONT COLOR=BLUE >blue lines</FONT> are in one family, and the set of
lines which meet all 
<FONT COLOR=BLUE >3 blue lines</FONT> is the other family
(in <FONT COLOR=FF0000>red</FONT>).
If we now consider the fourth 
<FONT COLOR=FF00FF>maroon line</FONT>, it will meet the 
<FONT COLOR=EEBB00>hyperboloid</FONT> in two points, the 
<FONT COLOR=FF00FF>maroon dots</FONT>.
Through each of these <FONT COLOR=FF00FF>maroon dots</FONT>
there will be a unique <FONT COLOR=FF0000>line</FONT> in the second family.
These two <FONT COLOR=FF0000>lines</FONT> are the two lines which meet our
four given lines.

<H3>The Reality of this discussion.</H3>
The careful reader will note that the 
<FONT COLOR=FF00FF>maroon line</FONT> need not intersect the 
<FONT COLOR=EEBB00>hyperboloid</FONT> in two points---besides the case of
tangency (which gives rise to a solution counted with multiplicity 
2)---it could be disjoint from the 
<FONT COLOR=EEBB00>hyperboloid</FONT>.
This shows that the proper setting for this problem is over the complex
numbers, where the <FONT COLOR=FF00FF>maroon line</FONT> will <I>always</I> 
meet the <FONT COLOR=EEBB00>hyperboloid</FONT>.
This is a manifestation of a general fact:  over the complex numbers,
enumerative geometric questions of this sort always have the same number of
solutions.
<P>
This picture illustrates a feature of the real numbers, that the number of
solutions to such questions may depend upon subtle properties of the
configurations of the conditions.
It is in general a difficult problem to determine how many real solutions
there are.
An upper bound is given by the number of complex solutions.
One may ask:
<P>
<B>When is this upper bound attained by real solutions?</B><BR><BR>

A recent theorem of says that this upper bound is
reached on many problems in enumerative geometry that arise from Schubert's
calculus. It is also attained for certain problems of
counting rational curves in a Grassmann variety, and for many problems
involving flags.
