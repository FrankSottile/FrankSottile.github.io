<p><b>Abstract:</b> 
A map from P^1 to P^n of degree d necessarily has
(n+1)(d-n+1) points where it is ramified, counted with multiplicities. We call
these inflection points, as in the image curve, a point of simple ramification
is an inflection point. A maximally inflected curve is a real curve, all of
whose inflection points are also real. The existence of such curves is
guaranteed by a result in the real Schubert calculus, and these curves are
closely related to an important conjecture in that field. Maximally inflected
plane curves satisfy some topological restrictions given by the Klein and
Pluecker formulas. They also satisfy some more subtle restrictions whose
existence was discovered experimentally. This talk will introduce these
objects, then discuss symbolic and numerical techniques to generate examples
of maximally inflected curves, and lastly describe the known topological
restrictions, including those whose existence is only suspected via
experiments.
