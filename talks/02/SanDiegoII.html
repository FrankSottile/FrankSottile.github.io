<p><b>Abstract:</b> The following geometric problem has its origins in 
computational vision: Determine the (degenerate) configurations of two 
lines <I>l</I><SUB>1</SUB> and <I>l</I><SUB>2</SUB> and two spheres in <B>R</B><SUP>3</SUP> for 
which there are infinitely many lines simultaneously transversal to 
<I>l</I><SUB>1</SUB> and <I>l</I><SUB>2</SUB> and tangent to both spheres. 
We generalize this, replacing the spheres by quadric surfaces 
in <B>P</B><SUP>3</SUP>. In this setting, the question has an amazing answer. 
Fixing the two lines to be skew and one quadric, the set of 
degenerate second quadrics is a curve of degree 24 in the 
<B>P</B><SUP>9</SUP> of quadrics which is in fact the union of 
12 plane conics! Moreover, there are examples where all 
12 degenerate families are real. We describe the symbolic 
computation behind this result and give some vivid pictures.
