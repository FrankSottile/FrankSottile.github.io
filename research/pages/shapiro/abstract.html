<H2>The Conjecture of Shapiro and Shapiro</H2>


<P>
Determining the number of real solutions to a system of polynomial equations
is a challenging  problem in symbolic and numeric computation 
[<a href="Bib.html#G-VRRT">G-VRRT</a>,<a href="Bib.html#St">St</a>]
with real world applications. 
Related questions include when a problem of 
enumerative geometry can have all real solutions 
[<a href="Bib.html#So97c">So97c</a>]
and when may a given physical system be controlled by real output
feedback [<a href="Bib.html">By</a>].
<!--\cite{Byrnes,RSW,SADG}. --> 
In May 1995, Boris Shapiro and Michael Shapiro
communicated to the author (Frank Sottile) a remarkable conjecture
connecting these 
three lines of inquiry. 
While this conjecture is false in the original generality, 
(see <a href="SectV.1.html">Section 5.i</a>) there is very
compelling evidence in support of a variant.
This is described in some detail in the paper 
<I>Real Schubert Calculus: Polynomial
Systems and a Conjecture of Shapiro and Shapiro</I>
[<A HREF="Bib.html#So98">So98</A>].

This document supplements that paper.
While you will find here a brief, self-contained description of the 
conjectures of Shapiro and Shapiro (and their relevance), the primary goal
is to give additional background to the paper, some relevant web
links, and present the computational evidence in more detail
than was possible in the paper.
This includes, as much as possible, documented programs in 
<A HREF="http://www.maplesoft.com/">Maple</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/~zca/Singular">SINGULAR</A>, and 
<A HREF="http://www.msri.org/people/members/jan/PHCpack/paper.html">PHC</A>, 
which may be run to verify some assertions in the paper, and help the
interested reader get started on these explorations.

<I>Real Schubert Calculus: Polynomial
Systems and a Conjecture of Shapiro and Shapiro</I>
is a companion to a paper of Verschelde [<A HREF="Bib.html#JV">V</A>] which
describes the mathematics involved in a 
spectacular computations he did to verify some instances of this
conjecture.
This document concentrates upon the polynomial systems and
computational aspects of the conjecture.

That paper and these computations directly inspired a breakthrough in this
area of real enumerative geometry.
After the paper on Shapiro's conjecture 
[<A HREF="Bib.html#So98">So98</A>] was written, Sottile
proved that for any enumerative problem involving linear
subspaces satisfying special Schubert conditions, it is possible to choose
real conditions so that all solutions are real 
[<a href="http:Bib.html#sottile">So99</a>]. (A special Schubert
condition is the condition that a <I>p</I>-plane meets another linear
subspace with excess intersection.)
It also holds for some problems of enumerating rational normal curves in a
Grassmann variety [<a href="http:Bib.html#sottile">So00a</a>], and for a
large class of enumerative problems involving flag manifolds 
[<a href="http:Bib.html#sottile">So00b</a>].
Even more recently, A.&nbsp;Gabrielov and A.&nbsp;Eremenko gave a proof of
the conjecture of Shapiro and Shapiro for Grassmannians of 2-dimensioinal
subspaces of a vector space [<a href="http:Bib.html#EG">EG</a>].
