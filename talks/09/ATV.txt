Arithmetic Toric Varieties

   Toric varieties are fundamental objects of 
combinatorial algebraic geometry.   The reason for 
this is that they are canonically associated to 
a fan in a lattice and may be viewed either as
varieties or as objects in geometric combinatorics.
They area also characterized as normal varieties 
that have an action of a diagonal (split) torus 
with a dense orbit.

   An arithmetic toric variety is a normal variety 
over a field k equipped with the action of a (non 
necessarily split) torus having a dense orbit.
Extending scalars to the algebraic closure, they
become a usual toric variety.  Their classification
involves is via nonabelian (Galois cohomology)
which mixes the combinatorics with the symmetry
of a discrete group action.

  In this talk, which represents joint work with 
Javier Elizondo, Paulo Lima-Filho, and Zach Teitler, 
I will introduce you to the topics of toric varieties 
and Galois cohomology, stating our classification 
theorem, present some examples, and discuss future
work in this area.  It is the foundation for our
work with Clarence Wilkerson on equivariant 
cohomology for real toric varieties, which is the
subject of a future talk.
