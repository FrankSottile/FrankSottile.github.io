<P>
The cohomology ring of the flag manifold has two distinguished bases:
monomials in tautological Chern classes and classes of Schubert varieties.
In 1982 Lascoux and Sch&uuml;tzenberger gave formulas for these Schubert
classes in terms of the monomial basis and used combinatorics to show
the resulting polynomials have non negative coefficients.
Geometrically, this positivity was a mystery: 
these monomials do not represent positive cycles, and existing combinatorial
constructions had no relation to geometry.

<P>
The main goal of this talk is to outline a geometric proof of this
positivity, identifying the coefficient of a monomial as an intersection
number. 
This joint work with Nantel Bergeron begins by studying certain maps between
flag manifolds, and then uses the Pieri formula for flag manifolds to
compute the resulting maps on cohomology.
This gives a new construction of these polynomial representatives and
identifies the coefficient of a monomial as an intersection number.

<P>
We will close with a potential application of these maps to studying 
singularities of Schubert varieties via pattern avoidance in permutations.
