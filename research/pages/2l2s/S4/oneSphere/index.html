<P> &nbsp; &nbsp;
In the pictures below, the sphere in <font color=red>red</font> is the 
original shere.
The lines perpendicular to the <I>x</I>-axis and
tangent to this sphere are drawn in <FONT COLOR="#99FF99">light
blue-green</font>.
Each quadric in <FONT COLOR="#FF00FF">Purple</FONT> 
is a member of one of the 
families of quadrics tangent to the same set of lines perpendicular to
the <I>x</I>-axis as the original sphere.
Of the 12 families given by our Theorem, only 4 contain real quadrics.
We display one real quadric from each family.
Linked pictures are to animated .gif files showing how the quadric moves
in the family.

<P> &nbsp; &nbsp;
Each family may perhaps best be thought of as parameterized by the points on a
hyperbola with affine equation <I>ab</I>-1, with smooth quadrics corresponding
to the points in the affine plane, but two singular members given by the two
points at infinity.
Our parameterization runs along one branch of this hyperbola, from 
<I>a</I>=sqrt(5)-2 to <I>a</I>=sqrt(5)+2, avoiding, but approaching the
singular members. 

<P> &nbsp; &nbsp;
These singular members are rank 2 quadrics with vertex either the <I>x</I>-axis
or the <I>y-z</I> plane at infinity (their zero set is two planes meeting
either in the <I>x</I>-axis or the <I>y-z</I> plane at infinity).
Either the two planes are real or they are complex conjugates.
In the first row, the two planes with vertex the <I>y-z</I> line at infinity
are complex conjugates, while in the second row, the two planes with vertex the 
<I>y-z</I> line at infinity are both real.
Similarly, in the first column, the two planes with vertex the <I>x</I>-axis
are complex conjugates, while in the second row, the two planes with vertex the 
<I>x</I>-axis are both real.
WARNING.  These movies are huge, from 374 Kb to 757 Kb.

These pictures were drawn with Maple.
An initial precomputation with Singular
computed the families.  
We have Maple files that draw each of the static pictures, 
(<A HREF="draw/a">NW</A>,
 <A HREF="draw/c">NE</A>,
 <A HREF="draw/b">SW</A>,
 <A HREF="draw/d">SE</A>)
an a single file for <A HREF="draw/animate.maple">animating</A> the families,
and one that <A HREF="draw/rotate.maple">rotates</A> the original sphere and
its transversal tangents.
