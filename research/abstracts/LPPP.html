<P>
 We study linear precision for multi-sided parametric patches of any dimension,
 showing that every proper parametric patch has a unique reparametrization which
 has linear precision and giving a geometric criterion for when this
 reparametrization is rational.
 For toric patches, this geometric criterion is equivalent to a certain toric
 differential defining a birational map. 
 While the reparametrization of a general toric patch having linear precision is not
 necesssarily a rational function, we show that it is computed by iterative proportional 
 fitting, a  numerical algorithm from statistics.
