  <td><h3>Above are two views of the same lecture hall.<br>
           This has 150 seats. It would be adequate with<br>
           a much better board (the current one is too small<br>
           and possibly too far back).  It might also benefit<br>
           from a generator.  <br>
           Temperatures in June can get 37 degrees or more.</h3>

    <h3>The Vice-Chancellor promised that we would have an<br>
           adequate,  recently rennovated lecture hall with<br>
            AC and a generator. Perhaps<br>
           details  of this should be settled upon?</h3>
   <br><br>
    <h3>To the right is a huge hall (seats 500)<br>
        which is much too large, but has AC,<br>
        and after rennovation has extra meeting rooms.<br>
        This is not appropriate for us.</h3>
