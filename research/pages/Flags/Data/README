Here, we have files that manage the .html files containing the data
in this experimental project.


CheckSums.maple     This prints out titles of data files whose tables do
                      not all have the same row sums.   Might modify this to 
                      be run in a shell script.

CheckTitles.maple   This checks to see if the file has the correct title, and if
CheckTitles.sh        not, it prints an error message.  Editing the file gives
                      the opportunity to rename the file.  It assumes that all 
                      files are in F1234.../ directories.
