<b>Title IX and Statement on Limits to Confidentiality</b>

Texas A&amp;M University is committed to fostering a learning environment that is safe and productive for all.
University policies and federal and state laws prohibit gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment,
including sexual assault, sexual exploitation, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking.<br>

With the exception of some medical and mental health providers, all university employees
(including full and part-time faculty, staff, paid graduate assistants, student workers, etc.) are Mandatory Reporters
and must report to the Title IX Office if the employee experiences, observes, or becomes aware of an incident that meets
the following conditions (see University Rule <a href="https://rules-saps.tamu.edu/PDFs/08.01.01.M1.pdf"><tt>08.01.01.M1</tt></a>):
  <ul>
    <li>The incident is reasonably believed to be discrimination or harassment. </li>
    <li>The incident is alleged to have been committed by or against a person who, at the time of the incident,
      was (1) a student enrolled at the University or (2) an employee of the University. </li>
 </ul>

Mandatory Reporters must file a report regardless of how the information comes to their attention&ndash;including but not limited to
  face-to-face conversations, a written class assignment or paper, class discussion, email, text, or social media post. Although Mandatory
  Reporters must file a report, in most instances, a person who is subjected to the alleged conduct will be able to control how the report
  is handled, including whether or not to pursue a formal investigation. The University's goal is to make sure you are aware of the range of
  options available to you and to ensure access to the resources you need. <br>

  Students wishing to discuss concerns in a confidential setting are encouraged to make an appointment with
  <a href="https://caps.tamu.edu/">Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)</a>.<br> 

Students can learn more about filing a report, accessing supportive resources, and navigating the Title IX investigation and resolution
  process on the University's <a href="https://titleix.tamu.edu/">Title IX webpage</a>.<br><br>
