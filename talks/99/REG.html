<P>
According to Schubert, enumerative geometry is concerned
with "questions of enumerating geometric figures of some kind having
specified positions with respect to general fixed figures".
We like to think of it as the geometric counterpart to the following question
concerning polynomial systems:
Suppose we have some family of systems of polynomial equations, what can we
say about the solutions to a fixed, but general member of that family?
Considering families of systems of equations is natural even when the
problem is to solve a single system, as it lives in a family obtained by
varying the parameters.
The geometric viewpoint has been very successful in accomplishing these
problems of enumeration.

<P>
 Often one wishes to have real solutions to a system of equations, and so the
 practical question is to say something about the real solutions.
 These 4 lectures will discuss some aspects of these questions.
 While they are connected by this theme, we intend them to be largely
 independent of each other.

<LI><B>Real Systems Solving</B><BR>
    
 We will discuss two problems that arose in applications, that of cylinders,
 and the Stewart platform in robotics.
 We discuss generalities about solving polynomial systems, describing two
 methods for solving systems, one
 symbolic (elimination theory and triangular systems) and one numerical
 (homotopy continuation).
 For both, we discuss how they have been used to study real solutions.<BR><BR>

<LI><B> Sparse Systems of Equations</B><BR>

 The algebra structure of systems of polynomials gives bounds on the
 number of solutions, and the best such are the BKK or polyhedral bounds.
 For real solutions, there are Khovanskii's fewnomial bounds.
 There are also numerical methods adapted to these sparse systems, and they
 lead to some lower bounds on the maximal number of real solutions.<BR><BR>

<LI><B>Real Enumerative Geometry</B><BR>

 We consider the geometric question of Fulton, who asked how
 many solutions to a problem of enumerative geometry can be real.
 Interestingly, in many cases, all solutions can be real.  We will first
 present some examples where this occurs, and then discuss the fascinating
 conjecture of Shapiro and Shapiro concerning the Schubert calculus of
 enumerative geometry.<BR><BR>

<LI><B>Real Schubert Calculus</B><BR>

 The conjectures of Shapiro and Shapiro are related to the pole placement
 problem from systems theory, and there is much evidence for their
 validity. 
 The most tantalizing evidence is the recent result that, for many problems
 from the Schubert calculus of enumerative geometry, all solutions may be
 real, which we will present.
