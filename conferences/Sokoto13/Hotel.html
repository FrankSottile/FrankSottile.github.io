<h2>Here are some photos from the UDU Sokoto Guest Inn.<br>
    This is where we'll have participants from out of Nigeria stay.<br>
    It has enough rooms with desks&mdash;so that the lecturers<br>
    can prepare their presentations.  It is also across the street from a Mosque.<br>
    It also has a manned gate, so it is more secure.</h2>
