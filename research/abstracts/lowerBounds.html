<H2>Lower Bounds for Real Solutions to Sparse Polynomial Systems</H2>

    E. Soprunova and F. Sottile.

<P>

We show how to construct sparse polynomial systems that have
 non-trivial lower bounds on their numbers of real solutions.
 These are unmixed systems associated to certain polytopes.
 For the order polytope of a poset <I>P</I> this lower bound is the sign-imbalance
 of <I>P</I> and it holds if all maximal chains of <I>P</I> have length of the same parity.
 This theory also gives lower bounds in the real Schubert calculus through sagbi
 degeneration of the Grassmannian to a toric variety, and thus recovers a result
 of Eremenko and Gabrielov.
