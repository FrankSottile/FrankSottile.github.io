     <p><b>27.14 </b><u>Parental Leave</u>. Effective July 1, 2001, full-time 
        tenured and tenure-track faculty members and librarians on multi-year 
        contracts who become biological or adoptive parents of a child under five 
        years of age shall receive, upon request, a one-semester paid leave. During 
        that semester, which shall be the semester in which the child’s birth 
        or adoption occurs or an adjacent semester, the faculty member or librarian 
        shall be required to use his or her accrued sick leave. Any otherwise 
        eligible faculty member or librarian with insufficient accrued sick leave 
        may draw against the sick leave bank. FMLA leave shall run concurrent 
        with such parental leave, and no affected faculty member of librarian 
        may use sick leave or the sick leave bank to extend this leave, unless 
        such an extension is medically indicated. Any faculty member or librarian 
        taking such a leave must join the sick leave bank prior to commencing 
        the leave and must return for one year of full-time service. <u>Parental 
        Postponement of TDY</u>. A non-tenured faculty member who becomes the 
        biological or adoptive parent of a child under five years of age may, 
        at his or her discretion, delay for one year his or her tenure decision 
        date. A faculty member choosing to exercise this option shall notify the 
        department chair, in writing, no later than six months after the birth 
        or adoption of the child or, if the faculty member takes a leave as described 
        in the paragraph above, no later than two months after the conclusion 
        of the leave. A faculty member may apply for such a delay for the birth 
        or adoption of subsequent children; the decision about whether to approve 
        such additional request(s) shall be entirely within the discretion of 
        the department chair. <u>Child Care</u>. The parties agree to establish 
        a joint committee, comprised of equal numbers of representatives of the 
        Amherst campus administration and the Union, to discuss the 1998 Report 
        of the Campus Child Care Planning Committee and the implementation of 
        the recommendations contained therein.
