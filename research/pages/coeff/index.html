<B>Abstract: </B> We describe how the following table concerning the
Littlewood-Richardson coefficients for Schubert polynomials was generated: 
<BR>

<DD>
<TABLE ALIGN=center BORDER=1>
<TR><TH>Symmetric group <TH>S_4<TH>S_5<TH>S_6<TH>S_7<TH>S_8
<TR><TH># Coeffs<TD>208<TD>3600<TD>81669<TD>2285414<TD>79860923
<TR><TH># distinct coeffs<TD>5<TD>12<TD>62<TD>332<TD>3267
</TABLE>

Here, we are considering the number of `Schubert-vs-Schur'
Littlewood-Richardson coefficients
<I>c<SUP>w</SUP><SUB>u,v(\lambda,k)</SUB></I> 
in the cohomology of a flag manifold, 
which is the coefficient of the Schubert class <I>S<SUB>w</SUB></I> in the 
product of a Schubert class <I>S<SUB>u</SUB></I> and a Schubert class
<I>S</I><SUB>\lambda</SUB> pulled back from the projection to 
Grass(<I>k</I>, <I>F<SUP>n</SUP></I>). 
Equivalently, this is the coefficient of a Schubert polynomial
<I>S<SUB>w</SUB></I> 
in the the product of a Schubert polynomial <I>S<SUB>u</SUB></I> with
a Schur polynomial 
<I>S</I><SUB>\lambda</SUB>(<I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB>,...,<I>x</I><SUB>k</SUB>).
Here, <I>u</I> and <I>w</I> are permutations in 
the symmetric group <I>S<SUB>n</SUB></I> and \lambda is a partition.

<P>
The first row records the total number of constants 
<I>c<SUP>w</SUP><SUB>u,v(\lambda,k)</SUB></I>
which may be non-zero.
That is, those triples <I>u</I>, <I>w</I>, and 
\lambda where <I>u</I>&lt;<I><SUB>k</SUB> w</I> are comparable in
the <I>k</I>-Bruhat order on <I>S<SUB>n</SUB></I>, and 
\lambda is a partition of <I>l</I>(<I>w</I>)-<I>l</I>(<I>u</I>),
with at most <I>k</I> parts. 
In the paper: <A HREF="../../abstracts.html#symmetry"><I>Schubert polynomials,
the Bruhat order and the geometry of Schubert varieties</I></A>,
we prove many identities among these constants, which show how to compute
all of the constants from a 
relative few, the number of which are recorded in the 
the second row.
This table is Table 1 in that paper.

<P>
To generate this table, we first obtained the following
data, for each <I>n</I>, <I>k</I>, and <I>r</I>.
These data are tabulated in the text files indicated.
Here n indexes a symmetric group <I>S<SUB>n</SUB></I>,
<I>k</I> ranges from 1 to <I>n</I>-1, 
it is the index of the <I>k</I>-Bruhat order, &lt;<I><SUB>k</SUB></I>,
and <I>r</I> is a rank.

<DL>
<DT><A HREF="Grassmann.betti">Grassmann.betti</A></DT>

<DD>
The number of partitions \lambda  with at most <I>k</I> rows 
and <I>n-k</I> columns.
For a fixed <I>k</I> and <I>n</I>, these are the Betti numbers of the
Grassmannian of <I>k</I>-planes in <I>n</I>-space.
This was generated by the C code 
<A HREF="Grassmann-Betti.c">Grassmann-Betti.c</A>.</DD>
<BR><BR>

<DT><A HREF="k-comparable.k-n">k-comparable.k-n</A></DT>

<DD>This file records the number of pairs of permutations 
(<I>u</I>,<I>w</I>)
in <I>S<SUB>n</SUB></I> with <I>u</I> less than <I>w</I> in the 
<I>k</I>-Bruhat order, and the length difference 
rank=<I>l</I>(<I>w</I>)-<I>l</I>(<I>u</I>).
We generated these data using a 
<A HREF="http://www.maplesoft.com/">MAPLE</A> script, 
<A HREF="k-comparable.maple">k-comparable.maple</A>
<BR><BR>

<DT><A HREF="zeta-orbits.rank">zeta-orbits.rank</A></DT>
<DD>
This file records, for each <I>n</I>, <I>k</I>, and rank, the number of 
equivalence classes of
irreducible full-support permutations \zeta in <I>S<SUB>n</SUB></I>
with that rank (in the Grassmann-Bruhat 
order) with exactly <I>k</I> numbers <I>a</I> with 
\zeta(<I>a</I>)&gt;<I>a</I>.
The equivalence here is generated by taking inverse (which interchanges 
<I>k</I> and <I>n-k</I>), conjugating with the longest element of the
symmetric group, and 
conjugating with the cycle (1,2,...,<I>n</I>), which we call `cyclic shift'.
This was generated with the C script, 
<A HREF="zeta-orbits.c">zeta-orbits.c</A>.
<P>
Representatives of these equivalence classes (for <I>n</I> at most 8)
are listed in the file
<A HREF="zeta-orbits.list">zeta-orbits.list</A>.
There, they are listed by <I>n</I> and <I>k</I>, and the cycles are written.
This list was computed using the 
<A HREF="http://www.maplesoft.com/">MAPLE</A> script, 
<A HREF="zeta-orbits.maple">zeta-orbits.maple</A>.
However, this script will output extra permutations, as it does not properly
screen for irreducibility.   

<P><HR></P>

To compute the number of <I>a priori</I> non-zero coefficients
<I>c<SUP>w</SUP><SUB>u,v(\lambda,k)</SUB></I>, 
for <I>u</I>, <I>w</I> in a given symmetric group, we
first  take the component-wise product of the first two tables, then add up
the entries. 
This gives the first row of the table above.
<P>

Using the identities we discovered, we can deterine the `new' coefficients
for each <I>n</I>.
By new, we mean those for which we do not have an identity linking them to
a coefficient from  <I>S<SUB>n</I>-1</SUB>.

We do this by taking the componentwise product of the first and third 
tables

Thus the second row is obtained by adding the entry for
<I>S<SUB>n</I>-1</SUB> to this 
number of `new' coefficients.
For <I>S</I><SUB>6</SUB>, <I>S</I><SUB>7</SUB>, and <I>S</I><SUB>8</SUB>, 
these calculations are done using the 
<A HREF="http://www.maplesoft.com/">MAPLE</A> scripts, 
<A HREF="S6-coeffs.maple">S6-coeffs.maple</A>,
<A HREF="S7-coeffs.maple ">S7-coeffs.maple </A>, and
<A HREF="S8-coeffs.maple">S8-coeffs.maple</A>.
For <I>S</I><SUB>4</SUB> and <I>S</I><SUB>5</SUB>, we did this by hand.

<P> 
<HR></P>

<H3>Why this works </H3>

<P>
It is clear that the first row is correct.
<P>
For the second, we showed in "Schubert polynomials..." show that the
coefficient 
<I>c<SUP>w</SUP><SUB>u,v(\lambda,k)</SUB></I>
 depends only upon \lambda and
\zeta:=<I>wu</I><SUP>-1</SUP> when 
<I>u &lt;<SUB>k</SUB> w</I>, thus we define 
<I>c</I><SUP>\zeta</SUP><SUB>\lambda</SUB>  to be  
<I>c<SUP>w</SUP><SUB>u,v(\lambda,k)</SUB></I>.
We showed this constant depends upon \zeta up to a linear relabeling of the
entries in a cycle, thus we may assume that \zeta has full support in 
<I>S</I><SUB>n</SUB>,
for otherwise we can compute <I>c</I><SUP>\zeta</SUP><SUB>\lambda</SUB>
 in a smaller symmetric group
or flag manifold.
This constant also only depends upon \zeta up to conjugation by the longest
element of <I>S</I><SUB>n</SUB>, and more mysteriously, only up to
conjugation by the cycle 
(1,2,...,<I>n</I>), which we call `cyclic shift'.
Since the constant <I>c</I><SUP>\zeta</SUP><SUB>\lambda</SUB>
 equals the constant
<I>c</I><SUP>\eta</SUP><SUB>\mu</SUB>, where \eta is the inverse of \zeta,
and \mu the transpose of 
\lambda, we further restrict ourselves.
Lastly, <I>c</I><SUP>\zeta</SUP><SUB>\lambda</SUB>
 will vanish if \lambda has more parts than there are
numbers a with \zeta(<I>a</I>)&gt;<I>a</I>.

<P>
Thus we only need tabulate the equivalence classes of permutations
\zeta which have full support, and with equivalence generated by cyclic
shift, conjugation by longest element, and inverse.
There is one further reduction possible:
We have a notion of reducible permutations \zeta=\eta\cdot\xi.
For these, <I>c</I><SUP>\zeta</SUP><SUB>\lambda</SUB>
may be calculated from
<I>c</I><SUP>\eta</SUP><SUB>\mu</SUB>
and <I>c</I><SUP>\xi</SUP><SUB>\nu</SUB>.


<P>
It should be clear that the second row is correct.

<H3>The Grassmann-Bruhat Order</H3>

<P>

While not needed to compute Table 1, we have also looked at the rank
distribution of this new partial order in small symmetric groups.
The results of this are tabulated in
<A HREF="neworder.ranks">neworder.ranks</A>,
which tabulates the rank statistics of elements in the Grassmann-Bruhat order
on <I>S</I><SUB>n</SUB>, for <n>n</I>=1,2,...,12
We originally computed the numbers up to <n>n</I>=11 with the 
<A HREF="http://www.maplesoft.com/">MAPLE</A> script,  
<A HREF="neworder.maple">neworder.maple</A>,
which computes the ranks of elements in the symmetric group in the
Grassmann-Bruhat order. 
On the MSRI cycle server (200 MHz HP 9000), this took over 2,000 minutes of
CPU time for <n>n</I>=11. 
The table has been extended using a C version of that script, 
<A HREF="neworder.c">neworder.c</A>,
which on Frank's little 133MHz Pentium laptop running Linux 
takes only 17 minutes for <n>n</I>=11. (240 minutes (4:10:40) when n=12.)
