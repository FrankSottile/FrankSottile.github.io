The Envelope of Lines Meeting a fixed line and Tangent to Two
          Spheres</H2>

  We study the set of lines that meet a fixed line and are tangent to two
 spheres and classify the configurations consisting of a single line
 and three spheres for which there are infinitely many lines tangent to the
 three spheres that also meet the given line.
 All such configurations are degenerate.
 The path to this result involves the interplay of some beautiful and
 intricate geometry of real surfaces in 3-space, complex algebraic
 geometry, explicit computation and graphics. <BR>
