The equation is determined by its zero set only up to multiplication by a
non-zero scalar.
Since there are 10 coefficients, the space of plane cubics
is a 9-dimensional projective space.

<P>
The condition for a cubic to contain a point is a linear condition on the
coefficients <I>A,...,J</I>.
In this way, we see that the space of cubics that meet 8 points is a
projective line.
If <I>p</I> and <I>q</I> are two different cubics that meet 8 given points,
then the set of cubics that meet those 8 points is given by all linear
combinations <I>Xp</I>+<I>Yq</I> of <I>p</I> and <I>q</I>.
Since <I>p</I> and <I>q</I> meet in a 9th point, it follows that every cubic in
this family also meets that same 9th point.

<P>
Since every other point in <B>P</B><SUP>2</SUP> contains a unique cubic in
this family, we see that there is a map from 
(<B>P</B><SUP>2</SUP> - 9pts) to the 
<B>P</B><SUP>1</SUP> of cubics <I>Xp</I>+<I>Yq</I>.
If we blow up the 9 points in <B>P</B><SUP>2</SUP>, we obtain a variety 
<I>Z</I>, 
and the map <I>f</I> from  <I>Z</I> to <B>P</B><SUP>1</SUP> is our family 
of cubics.
(The fibre over a point <I>Xp</I>+<I>Yq</I> of <B>P</B><SUP>1</SUP>
is the plane cubic defined by the polynomial <I>Xp</I>+<I>Yq</I>.)

<HR>
<P>
<B>The Complex Case.</B> &nbsp;
We first compute the Euler characteristic of <I>Z</I>.
Since blowing up a point in a surface amounts to removing that point and
replacing it with a <B>P</B><SUP>1</SUP>, each blow-up adds 1=2-1 to the Euler
characteristic of the surface.
(The point has Euler characteristic 1, and <B>P</B><SUP>1</SUP>
 has Euler characteristic 2.)
In this way, we see that the Euler characteristic of <I>Z</I> is 12.

<P>
Consider the fibres of this map <I>f</I>.
A general plane cubic is smooth and is homeomorphic to 
(<I>S</I><SUP>1</SUP>)<SUP>2</SUP>, it has Euler characteristic 0.
Thus the only contributions to the Euler characteristic of <I>Z</I> comes
from singular fibres, that is rational plane cubics.
If the 8 points are in general position, then we may assume that the family 
<I>Z</I> does not contain any cuspidal cubics, and so its singular fibres
must all be nodal cubics.
A nodal cubic is obtained from the 2-sphere by identifying 2 points
(or contracting a simple <I>S</I><SUP>1</SUP> in the
 torus (<I>S</I><SUP>1</SUP>)<SUP>2</SUP>).
Thus the Euler characteristic of a nodal cubic is 1.

<P>
From this consideration, we see that there are exactly 12 singular fibres,
and each is a nodal rational plane cubic containing the 8 points.

<HR>
<P>
<B>The Real Case.</B> &nbsp;
Suppose the 8 points are real.
Then so is the 9th point, and we consider the real points 
<I>X</I><SUB><B>R</B></SUB> of a variety <I>X</I>.
As before, we compute the Euler characteristic of 
<I>Z</I><SUB><B>R</B></SUB>. 
When a point on a real surface is blown up, we replace it by 
<B>P</B><SUP>1</SUP><SUB><B>R</B></SUB>=<I>S</I><SUP>1</SUP>.
This lowers the Euler characteristic by 1, as 
<I>S</I><SUP>1</SUP> has zero Euler characteristic.
Since <B>P</B><SUP>2</SUP><SUB><B>R</B></SUB> has Euler characteristic 
1, we see that <I>Z</I><SUB><B>R</B></SUB> has Euler characteristic 1-9=-8.

<P>
A non-singular real cubic has either 1 or 2 disjoint components, each
homeomorphic to  
<I>S</I><SUP>1</SUP>, and so as in the complex case, the nonsingular fibres
of <I>Z</I><SUB><B>R</B></SUB> do not contribute to its Euler
characteristic.
Unlike the complex case, there are 2 different real nodal cubics,
distinguished by the tangent lines to the branches at the node---either both
tangent directions are real, or else they are complex conjugate.
We display both below, the cubic on the left has 2 real tangent directions
and the one on the right has complex conjugate directions.
<BR>
<TABLE  ALIGN=center><TR>
<TD><IMG SRC="figures/renodes.gif">

</TABLE>
Call these cubics real nodal and complex nodal, respectively.
The real nodal cubic is topologically a figure 8, and so has Euler
characteristic -1
and the complex nodal cubic is the disjoint union of a point and 
<I>S</I><SUP>1</SUP>, and so has Euler characteristic 1.

<P>
Thus we see that the number of real nodal  cubics minus the number of
complex nodal cubics equals 8.
We enumerate the different possibilities:
<BR>
<TABLE ALIGN=left BORDER=1>
<TR><TH> # real nodal
   <TD>&nbsp;8&nbsp;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;10&nbsp;
<TR> <TH> # complex nodal
   <TD>&nbsp;0&nbsp;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;
<TR>    <TH> # real rational cubics
 <TD>&nbsp;8&nbsp;<TD>&nbsp;10&nbsp;<TD>&nbsp;&nbsp;12&nbsp;
</TABLE>
<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>

<P>
Thus to see that there are 8 points in the plane such that all 12 rational
cubics that meet them are real, we need only exhibit 2 complex nodal cubics
that meet in 9 points:
If we choose any 8 of those points, then the family of cubics meeting those
8 points contains also 10 real nodal cubics.
We display 2 such complex nodal cubics below.

<P>
We close with the following observation that in this problem of cubics, not
all possible numbers of real cubics (0, 2, 4, 6, ....) can occur.
