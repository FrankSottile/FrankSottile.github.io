<p>
   In 1984, Fulton asked how many solutions to a problem of enumerative
geometry can be real, when that problem is one of counting geometric figures
of some kind having specified position with respect to some general fixed
figures.   In every instance known, the surprising answer is that all may be
real.  This includes the problem of 3264 conics tangent to 5 plane plane
conics, and 2-planes in a vector space satisfying Schubert conditions.
<p>
   The purpose of this talk is to announce and prove the following
breakthrough, namely that for <I>any</I> problem of enumerating
<I>p</I>-planes in a vector space having excess intersection with a
collection of fixed linear 
subspaces, there is a choice of the fixed subspaces such that each of the
resulting <I>p</I>-planes is real.   The fixed planes may be chosen to
osculate a 
rational normal curve at real points.   In this way, this result is a case
of a remarkable conjecture of Shapiro and Shapiro, and has connections to
the pole placement problem in linear systems theory.
