varieties.</font><BR>
 <A HREF="http://www.math./"></A>Prakash Belkale, North Carolina.</b>
 <p>
 We define a new ("smaller") product on the cohomology of projective homogenous
spaces <I>G</I>/<I>P</I> based on a geometric degeneration and show that it this
product 
which is relevant to Eigenvalue problems and the Geometric Horn problem. We
exhibit a relation   of this product to Lie algebra cohomology. We also obtain
two (a priori) different sets of necessary recursive conditions  on when a
cohomology product of Schubert cycles in a <I>G</I>/<I>P</I> is non-zero (the
Geometric Horn problem).

 <p>
 We describe the <I>T</I>-equivariant cohomology of the Quot scheme
compactifying the space of degree <I>d</I> maps from <b>P</b><sup>1</sup>
to the Grassmannian Gr(<i>r</I>,<i>n</i>), where <i>T</I> is the product of
the natural torus acting on the Grassmannian with a <b>c</b><SUP>*</SUP>
acting on <b>P</b><sup>1</sup>.  The calculation is by equivariant localization.
The one-dimensional orbits are not isolated, but we
can describe explicitly the relations coming from each connected family of
one-dimensional orbits, since the closure of each such family is a product of
projective spaces.

This is joint work with Linda Chen and Frank Sottile.

 <A HREF="http:/"></A>Andrei Gabrielov, Purdue University.</b>
 <p>
 We single out some problems of Schubert calculus of subspaces of codimension
2 that have the property that all their solutions are real whenever the data
are real. For other similar problems we prove non-trivial lower bounds for the
number of real solutions.
Our arguments explore the connection between subspaces of codimension 2 and
rational functions of one variable. Part of these results is our joint work
with M. Shapiro and A. Vainshtein.

 <A HREF="http://www.math./"></A>Megumi Harada, Toronto.</b>
 <p>
 Explicit computations of equivariant cohomology rings have many
applications. In 1998, Goresky, Kottwitz, and MacPherson showed that for
certain spaces with a torus action, the equivariant cohomology ring can be
explicitly described by combinatorial data obtained from its orbit
decomposition. We generalize their theorem to the (possibly
infinite-dimensional) setting of cell complexes. These results include
many new examples, including homogeneous spaces of a loop group <i>LG</I>.

 <A HREF="http://www.math./"></A>Joel Kamnitzer, Berkeley.</b>
 <p>
 Mirkovic-Vilonen showed that certain subvarieties of the affine
Grassmanian, called Mirkovic-Vilonen cycles, give bases for
representations of complex semisimple groups.  Anderson observed that to each
MV cycle, it is possible to associate its moment map image, called a
Mirkovic-Vilonen polytope.  He showed that these polytopes can be used to count
tensor product multiplicities.\par
Here, we give a uniform description of the MV cycles and polytopes for all
complex semisimple groups.  Our description is in terms of the combinatorics
developed by Berenstein-Zelevinsky in their tensor product multiplicities
paper. However, our work does not rely on their results and it gives a new
proof of their tensor product multiplicity formula.

 <A HREF="http://www.math./"></A>Allen Knutson, Berkeley.</b>
 <p>
 Misha Kogan selected a strange-looking subset of the ``Schubert
polynomial times Schur polynomial'' class of problems: the Schubert
polynomial shouldn't mention any of the variables the Schur doesn't.
In particular, it includes the usual Littlewood-Richardson problem,
in which the Schubert polynomial is another Schur polynomial,
in the same number of variables.
<p>
We use the transition formula for Grothendieck polynomials (which is
given a geometric explanation in Alex Yong's talk) to give a
satisfying explanation of the naturality of Kogan's condition, while
giving a simpler derivation, and one which extends to <i>K</I>-theory (but
not equivariantly!).
<p>
Our rule is in terms of ``marching moves'' on the diagram of a
permutation.

 <A HREF="http://math.albany.edu:8000/math/pers/lenart/">Cristian Lenart</A>, University at Albany.</b>
 <p>
We present new Chevalley-type and Pieri-type multiplication formulas in the
<I>T</I>-equivariant <I>K</I>-theory of generalized flag varieties 
<I>G</I>/<I>P</I>. By these, we
mean formulas for multiplying arbitrary Schubert classes in equivariant
<I>K</I>-theory, on the one hand, with classes of certain line bundles, and
Schubert classes indexed by simple reflections, on the other hand. The
construction is given in terms of decompositions of a fixed affine Weyl group
element, and saturated chains in the Bruhat order on the (nonaffine) Weyl
group. Our model has certain advantages over the Littelmann path model, on
which a Chevalley-type formula due to Pittie and Ram is based. As an
application, we are able to give simple proofs of certain symmetries of the
coefficients in the Chevalley-type formula, which are difficult to derive by
other methods. This is a joint work with Alexander Postnikov. We also discuss
the way in which our model leads to a more general multiplication formula (by
certain Schubert classes pulled back from a Grassmannian projection) in the
<I>K</I>-theory of the type <I>A</I> flag variety. The latter formula was obtained in
collaboration with Frank Sottile.

 <A HREF="http://www.math./">Leonardo Constantin Mihalcea</A>, University of Michigan.</b>
 <p>
 The (small) equivariant quantum cohomology (eq.q.coh.) of a
(smooth) variety <i>X</i> is an algebra which is a deformation of both
equivariant and quantum cohomology algebras of <i>X</i>.

<P>
In this talk I will present two properties of the equivariant quantum cohomology
of the Grassmannian
which extend from its equivariant restriction. One is that there is a certain
recurrence relation, which is implied by the equivariant quantum  Pieri rule
(i.e. the 
multiplication with the divisor class), and which determines completely the
eq.q. multiplication.
<P>
nd is a positivity property of the structure constants of the
equivariant quantum cohomology, which are certain polynomials (the 3-point,
genus 0, equivariant Gromov-Witten invariants, introduced by Givental and
Kim). This positivity holds for any homogeneous space <i>G</i>/<i>P</i> and
generalizes the equivariant positivity conjectured by 
Peterson and proved by Graham.

 <A HREF="http://www.math.berkeley.edu/~bosserman/">Brian Osserman</A>, Berkeley and MSRI.</b>
 <p>
 
We discuss the question of transversality of Schubert cycles which are not
general, but are associated to osculating flags at general points of the
rational normal curve. This question may be rephrased in terms of maps from the
projective line to projective spaces with prescribed ramification, and in this
context it is natural to ask the same question for higher-genus curves as well.
We give a simple degeneration argument using the theory of limit linear series
to reduce the problem to the case of three ramification points on the
projective line. We also discuss the consequences of this argument for reality
of the maps in question. <BR><A HREF="index.html">Back</A>

 <A HREF="http://www.math./"></A>Alexander Postnikov, MIT.</b>
 <p>
 We study a family of polynomials whose values
express degrees of Schubert varieties in the
generalized flag manifold <I>G</I>/<I>B</I>.  The polynomials
are given by weighted sums over saturated chains in the Bruhat order.   
We derive several explicit formulas for these polynomials, and investigate
their relations with Schubert polynomials, harmonic polynomials, 
Demazure characters, and generalized Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.
We specialize the results to the classical (type <I>A</I>) flag manifold 
and discuss related combinatorial objects: flagged Schur polynomials, 312-avoiding
permutations, generalized Gelfand-Tsetlin
polytopes, Stanley-Pitman polytopes, parking
functions, binary trees, and the inverse extended
Kostka matrix.  The talk is based on a joint work
with Richard Stanley.

 <A HREF="http://www.math./">Kevin Purbhoo</A>, Fields Institute.</b>
 <p>
 Horn's conjecture as classically stated, is a statement about the
possible eigenvalues of triples of Hermitian matrices (<I>A</I>,<I>B</I>,<I>C</I>)
satisfying <I>A</I>+<I>B</I>+<I>C</I>=0.  Restated however, it can be viewed as a
recursive construction of the set of non-vanishing
Littlewood-Richardson numbers.  We prove a generalisation of Horn's
conjecture, which recursively characterises the non-vanishing Schubert
intersection numbers for all minuscule flag varieties.

 <p>
 Giambelli's formula computes the class of an orbit closure in
the <I>GL</I>(<i>n</I>) \times <I>GL</I>(<i>p</I>)-equivariant cohomology of 
HOM(<B>C</B><SUP><i>n</i></SUP>,<B>C</B><SUP><i>p</i></SUP>).
In this talk we will present some new results in two different
natural generalizations. (1) Quiver representations occur when we consider
direct sums of HOM spaces---instead of just one of them---arranged with
respect to a diagram. We will show how a simplification of earlier work (by A.
Buch, L. Feher, R.R.), gives the sought equivariant class formulas in the 
<I>A<SUB>n</SUB></I>
quiver case (arbitrarily oriented) [joint work with A. Buch]. (2) Instead of
linear maps we can consider holomorphic germs from <B>C</B><SUP><i>n</i></SUP> 
to <B>C</B><SUP><i>p</i></SUP>. Then
generalizations of the Giambelli formula are called the Thom polynomials of
singularities. We will present a so far hidden structure of these Thom
polynomials [joint work with L. Feher].

 <p>
 The Shapiro conjecture in the real Schubert calculus fails to hold for flag
manifolds, but in a very interesting way. We give a refinement of that
conjecture for the flag manifold and present massive experimentation that
supports this conjecture. We also prove many special cases using discriminants
and establish relationships between the different cases of the conjecture.<BR>

 <A HREF="http://wwwmath.berkeley.edu/~speyer/">David E. Speyer</A>, Berkeley.</b>
 <p>
 The multiplicative version of Horn's problem asks what the
possible critical values of three matrices <I>A</I>, <I>B</I> and <I>C</I> are, given
<I>ABC</I>=1. 
A Vinnikov curve is a projective plane curve which can be written
as det(<I>xX</I>+<I>yY</I>+<I>zZ</I>)=0 with 
<I>X</I>, <I>Y</I> and <I>Z</I> positive definite Hermitian
matrices; Vinnikov has solved the problem of classifying such curves. We
will relate these two problems to each other and pose tropical versions of
them. This allows us to reprove Knutson and Tao's criterion for the
solvability of Horn's problem in terms of honeycombs and illuminate the
origins of honeycombs.

 <p>
 
Subvarieties of the flag variety defined by certain linear conditions
arise naturally in many areas, including geometric representation theory,
number theory, and numerical analysis.  These subvarieties, called
Hessenberg varieties, are naturally paved by the intersection of a Bruhat
decomposition with the Hessenberg variety.  In many cases, the Bruhat
decomposition can be chosen so that each Schubert cell intersects the
Hessenberg variety in an affine cell.  We discuss properties of this cell
decomposition.  In particular, we show that the Poincare polynomials of a
family of Hessenberg varieties factor in a way that generalizes the
exponents of the group.  Part of these results are joint work with E.&nbsp;Sommers.

 <A HREF="http://www.math./">Ravi Vakil</A>, Stanford University.</b>
 <p>
 Enumerative problems in geometry often have groups attached, which have
different interpretations in geometry, arithmetic, and algebra.  The geometric
interpretation is as follows:  if the problem has <i>N</i> solutions, and the
conditions are moved about and returned to their starting positions, how can
the <i>N</i> solutions be permuted?  Schubert problems are the only known enumerative
problems that can have unexpectedly small Galois groups; the first such example
is due to Derksen.  By solving Schubert problems over the rational numbers (and
using Schubert induction) we can compute these monodromy groups explicitly; we
give examples where it is the full symmetric group, and where it seems to be
mysteriously small.  This is part of a larger project with Sara Billey.

  The pole placement problem asks to find laws to feed the output of
a plant governed by a linear system of differential equations back to the
input of the plant, so that the resulting closed-loop system has a desired set
of eigenvalues. In this talk, we first show the connection between dynamic
output feedback pole placement and enumerative geometry. Then we will present
the realization of the output of the Pieri Homotopies as a useful control
feedback machine in the time domain, which will involve numerical calculations
of greatest common divisor. An application will be presented to illustrate
real feedback laws may be found with dynamic feedback method when all the
static feedback laws have nonzero imaginary coefficients. We implemented a
parallel version of Pieri Homotopy algorithm and observed the algorithm is
suitable for parallel computing.

 transition formulae.</font><BR> 
 <A HREF="http://www.math./"></A>Alexander Yong, Berkeley.</b>
 <p>
 We geometrically interpret Alain Lascoux's transition formula for Grothendieck
polynomials. For a permutation \pi thought of
as a permutation matrix, let X_\pi be the closure (in the set of 
complex <i>n</I>-by-<i>n</I>-matrices) of the double coset
 <i>B</I><sub>-</sub> \pi <i>B</I><sub>+</sub>.
This is a <font color=red><i>matrix Schubert variety</I></font>.
We construct a flat family whose general fiber is isomorphic
to X_\pi and whose special fiber is reduced and Cohen-Macaulay.
The components of the limit are also matrix Schubert varieties (one of which is
intersected with an
``irrelevant'' coordinate hyperplane).
We relate this geometry to some subtraction-free formulae (both new and old)
from the study of (K-theory) Schubert calculus and degeneracy loci; see Allen
Knutson's talk. For example, we deduce another geometric interpretation of the
classical Littlewood-Richardson rule, as counting components of a partially
degenerated matrix Schubert variety.
