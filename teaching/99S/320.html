<H2><A NAME="overview"><FONT COLOR=AA00FF>Overview</FONT></A></H2>
<P>
This course will serve as an introduction to ordinary differential equations
and linear algebra.
Differential equations are `the language of the laws of nature'.
Many important physical problems are formulated in terms of solutions to a
differential equation. 

<P>
Linear algebra concerns itself with the structure of systems of linear
equations. 
Such equations are ubiquitous in applications, in part because they arise as
first order approximations to more difficult non-linear phenomena.
Another reason for their importance is that there are efficient algorithms
for solving them and analyzing their solutions.

<P>
These two subjects come together in the subject of systems of first order
linear differential equations, and a major goal of this course is to study
such systems.

<HR> 
<H2><A NAME="computing"><FONT COLOR=AA00FF>Technology</FONT></A></H2>

<P> 
An important component of this course will be some numerical experimentation
and homeworks.
I recommend using the package MATLAB, but you may do these in any computer
algebra system you choose.
The mathematics departmental computer facilities are located on the first
floor of Van Vleck hall,  this is the bunker-like structure protruding from
the classroom wing of the building.

<DT><B> In Term Exams:</B>  

  <DD>There will be two one hour in term exams;
The first will be Thursday, 25 February and the second will be 
Thursday, 8 April, both in class. 
(The second date is only approximate.)
Calculators are allowed on all tests.
There will be no makeup tests, and you are excused from exams only for
well-documented emergencies.

<DT><B> Homework:</B>  
   <DD>I will assign <A HREF="homework_320.html#bottom">homework</A>
   regularly, and homework will be due on the following Thursdays, 
February 4, 11, and 18, March 4, 18, and 25, April 1,
   22, and <FONT COLOR=FF0000>29</FONT>,
<FONT COLOR=44BB00>Final, MATLAB homework due 4 May</FONT>. 
Our grader will have your work marked by the following Tuesday.
<I> Late homeworks will not be accepted.</I>

<FONT COLOR=FF0000><B>Final Exam:</B> 
<DD>Room 1641 Humanities Building.  12:25 PM
Thursday, 13 1999.</FONT>


<DT><B> Grading:</B>  
<DD>Each  in term exam 
will count 1/5, and the homeworks will count also 1/5 of your final mark,
and the final exam will count 2/5.
