Agreed. Along those same lines, one of the things my colleagues are asking for is an official statement from the University (or perhaps from the Faculty Senate?), especially one that is designed to be placed in all TAMU syllabi, explicitly laying out TAMU’s position on academic freedom and inquiry. This could be a statement that refers to the SAP on academic freedom and responsibility and that spells out the expectations that students should have when they go into a classroom. Section 3 of the SAP, with details on both rights and responsibilities, could be a potential basis for constructing this statement.

 

For example, from the SAP:

“Academic Freedom: Institutions of higher education exist for the common good. The common good depends upon an uninhibited search for truth and its open expression. Hence, it is essential that faculty members be free to pursue scholarly inquiry without undue restriction, and to voice and publish individual conclusions concerning the significance of evidence that they consider relevant. Each faculty member must be free from the corrosive fear that others inside or outside the University community, because their views may differ, may threaten his or her professional career or the material benefits accruing from it. Each faculty member is entitled to full freedom in the classroom in discussing the subject being taught.”

 

Best,
