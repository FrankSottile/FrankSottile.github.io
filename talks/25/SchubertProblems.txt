This is a series of informal discussions about Grassmannians and flag varieties,
with the goal of describing both how to represent Schubert problems on a
computer and some goals of this computational study.   This includes reality,
Galois groups, and new work around the Wronski map.

Discussion 1:  28 January 2025

Defined Grassmannian and its projective embedding.  Explained Stiefel
coordinates and began to discuss it decomposition into Schubert cells.

Discussion 2:  4 February 2025

Schubert decomposition and Schubert varieties for the Grassmannian.
