Critical points of discrete periodic operators

It is believed that the dispersion relation of a Schroedinger operator
with a periodic potential has non-degenerate critical points.  In work
with Kuchment and Do, we considered this for discrete operators on a
periodic graph G, for then the dispersion relation is an algebraic
hypersurface. A consequence is a dichotomy; either almost all
parameters have all critical points non-degenerate or almost all
parameters give degenerate critical points, and we showed how tools
from computational algebraic geometry may be used to study the
dispersion relation.

  With Matthew Faust, we use ideas from combinatorial algebraic
geometry to give an upper bound for the number of critical points at
generic parameters, and also a criterion for when that bound is
obtained.  The dispersion relation has a natural compactification in a
toric variety, and the criterion concerns the smoothness of the
dispersion relation at toric infinity.  This toric variety has a
twisted real structure with the dispersion relation a real algebraic
subvariety whose real points compactify the real dispersion relation.
