<font color=maroon><h3>Week &Omega;: 23 April 2017. </h3></font>
<ul>
  <li><font color=maroon><B>Opening Remarks:</b></font>
  This is our last week.<br><br>

  &nbsp; &nbsp;
  The development of set theory, especially Cantor's revolutionary ideas, led us to finally develop a theory of infinity as a quantity, a notion that
  vexed the Greeks.
  The roots of this were mathematicians trying to understand the very strange sets that came up in understanding aspects of the convergence of Fourier
  series (another topic mentioned only in passing that led to great mathematical developments in analysis, number theory, and combinatorics&ndash;look
  up the work of Tim Gowers who was a fellow student at Cambridge when I was there).
  In fact, some have said that Cantor developed the first new branch of mathematics since antiquity;
  Algebra is as old as counting, and came into its own certainly in China, India, and the Islamic world.
  Geometry was developed to a high degree by the Greeks, 
  and Analysis, while it was an outgrowth of the Calculus, can be said to have its origins at least in the amazing approximations of Archimedes.
  Cantor's theory of infinite sets is also remarkably accessible; my high school calculus teacher presented to us the Cantor `middle third' set,
  as well as his diagonal proof that there are more real numbers than integers&ndash;this is a topic I enjoy presenting when I talk to
  highschool students and in-service teachers.
  I aso had about 8-10 graduate courses on set theory, logic, and foundations, so I have a soft spot for this.
   <br>  In your reading, Stillwell makes an ommission on page 527; the sequence {<i>x<sub>i</sub></i>: <i>i</i> in <b>N</b>} needs to include all
    real numbers, the construction does not work for every sequence, for example 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, .....<br>
Having re-read this chapter, I now do not like Stillwell's take on these foundational questions.<br>
Let me add a bit to the ideas presented in Chapter 24.
Some of the results, G&ouml;del's incompleteness theorem, the independence of the continuum hypothesis, and the negative solution to the halting
problem, are of similar nature in that science has proven that there are limits to our knowledge&ndash;some things are not knowable.
They have a similar feel to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

  Lastly, you will read about combinatorics, which is the study of counting or of discrete mathematical structures.
  While often derided as a mile wide and an inch deep, this mathemartical area has come into its own in the past 100 years, 
  and is increasingly important.
  Many people argue that it should be taught instead of Calculus (last year, a friend from graduate school who gave a distingushed lecture at
  Texas A&amp;M, made this point in a talk she gave&ndash;this is Kristin Lauter, the Research Manager for the Cryptography Group at Microsoft
  Research)
  I also work in combinatorics, among other mathematical topics, so again I have a soft spot for it.
  Lest you think that my prejudices are guiding the last few weeks, I am also a huge fan of algebraic number theory, even though I do not 
  work in it.<br><br>
  </li>

  <li><font color=maroon><B>Reading:</b></font>
    <dd> Chapters 24 and 25 of Stillwell.
    <dd> Read Bell's chapter on Cantor.<br><br>
  </li>

 <li><font color=maroon><b>Assignment:</b></font> Due Monday, 30 April 2018. (HW 16)

       Email a .pdf to <A HREF="http://www.math.tamu.edu/~mehrzad/">Mehrzad Monzavi</A>
   <TT><a href="mailto:Mehrzad@math.tamu.edu">Mehrzad@math.tamu.edu</a></TT>.

   <ol>

     <li>Do the exercise on the four-cube. What is the Euler characteristic of the <i>n</i>-cube?  By this I mean the alternating sum of the
         numbers of faces:  Number of vertices - number of edges + number of 2-faces - ... (-1)<sup><i>n</i>-1</sup> number of (<i>n</i>-1)-faces. </li>
    <li>In Chapter 24, do the exercises 24.2.1 and 24.2.2.</li>
    <li>In Chapter 25, do the exercises 25.5.2, 25.5.4, and 25.5.5</li>
  </ol>
 </li>
