Archimedean Solids

Most of us know the five Platonic (or regular) solids; next 
to the sphere, they are the most regular and beautiful objects 
in our three-dimensional world.  Less well-known are the 
Archimedean or semi-regular solids.   In this math circle 
activity, we will recall the Platonic solids, and then 
explore the Archimedean solids, and some relations between
them.  We will be building them and then studying our
constructions.  If time, I will explain their relation to
fair dice.
