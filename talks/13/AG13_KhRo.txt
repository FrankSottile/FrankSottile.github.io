Khovanskii-Rolle Continuation for Real Solutions

Abstract. Over 30 years ago, Askold Khovanskii used a multivariate generalization 
of Rolle's Theorem to give a bound on the number of positive solutions to a system 
of polynomial equations that depends only on the number of terms appearing in the 
equations, and not on their degree. Reflecting this dependence, this class of bounds 
are called fewnomial bounds. Khovanskii's proof was revisited by Bihan and Sottile, 
who gave a refined bound that is asymptotically sharp, in a certain sense. 
Subsequently, we observed that Khovanskii's use of Rolle's Theorem can form the 
basis of a continuation algorithm for numerically computing the real solutions to 
a system of fewnomials. This Khovanskii-Rolle algorithm finds the real solutions by 
following real arcs, and avoids computing complex solutions to the fewnomial system. 
Consequently its complexity depends upon the fewnomial bound and not on the number 
of complex solutions.

This talk will explain this Khovanskii-Rolle algorithm and describe some technical 
challenges that are encountered in its implementation. This represents joint work 
with Dan Bates.
