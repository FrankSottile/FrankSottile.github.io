<H2>1.i. Real Enumerative Geometry</H2>


In the last century, Schubert asked questions like the following:
"Given <I>mp</I> <I>m</I>-planes in <I>C<SUP>m+p</SUP></I>, how many
<I>p</I>-planes meet each of the <I>m</I>-planes non-trivially?"
He developed algorithms (often called the Schubert calculus) for answering
such questions.
In particular, he determined there are exactly<BR>

</TABLE>
<I>p</I>-planes which meet <I>mp</I> general <I>m</I>-planes non-trivially.
For instance, there are 2 lines in <I>P</I><SUP>3</SUP> which meet 4 given
lines.

Another famous geometric problem is that of conics tangent to five general
conics.
In 1864 Chasles showed there are 3264 plane conics tangent to five given
plane conics.

In 1984 Fulton [<a href="http:Bib.html#Fulton">Fu</a>] asked if it were
possible to choose the 5 conics so that all 3264 tangent conics were real.
More generally, he asked if it were possible to do this for other
enumerative geometric problems like the questions of Schubert.
For us, this asks if one may choose the <I>mp</I> 
<I>m</I>-planes so that each of the  <I>d<SUB>m,p</SUB></I> &nbsp;
<I>p</I>-planes are real.
This is the case of the problem of 2 lines in <I>P</I><SUP>3</SUP> meeting 4
given lines, which is not hard to see (a 
<a href="4lines.html">description</a> of the geometry of this case).
The first question was answered affirmatively by Fulton (unpublished) and by
Ronga, Tognoli, and Vust [<a href="Bib.html#RTV">RTV</a>].
<!-- (See also Conics page)  -->
The second was answered affirmatively when either <I>m</I> or <I>p</I> are 2
by Sottile in his Ph.D. thesis [<a href="Bib.html#So94">So94</a>], published
as [<a href="Bib.html#So97a">So97a</a>].
A few other cases of this phenomenon, including the <I>d</I><SUB>3,3</SUB>(=42)
3-planes in <I>C</I><SUP>6</SUP> meeting 9 general 3-planes nontrivially
were settled in [<a href="Bib.html#So97b">So97b</a>,
   <a href="Bib.html#So97c">So97c</a>].
Other examples of this phenomenum include the 40 positions of Stewart
platform  in robotics [<A href="Bib.html">D</A>] and the 12 rational cubics
meeting 8 points in <B>P</B><SUP>2</SUP> [<A href="Bib.html#Kh">Kh</A>].
(A <A HREF="real_cubics.html">description</A> of this problem of cubics.)

After the paper on Shapiro's conjecture 
[<A HREF="Bib.html#So99">So98</A>] was written, Sottile
proved this is the case for any enumerative problem involving linear
subspaces satisfying special Schubert conditions 
[<a href="http:Bib.html#So99">So99</a>]. (A special Schubert
condition is the condition that a <I>p</I>-plane meets another linear
subspace with excess intersection.)
It also holds for some problems of enumerating rational normal curves in a
Grassmann variety [<a href="http:Bib.html#So99">So00a</a>], and for a
large class of enumerative problems involving flag manifolds 
[<a href="http:Bib.html#So99">So00b</a>].
Even more recently, A.&nbsp;Gabrielov and A.&nbsp;Eremenko gave a proof of
the conjecture of Shapiro and Shapiro for Grassmannians of 2-dimensioinal
subspaces of a vector space [<a href="http:Bib.html#EG">EG</a>].
