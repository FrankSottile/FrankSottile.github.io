<P>

It is a difficult problem  to say anything meaningful about the number
of real  solutions to  a system of  equations. Recently,  Eremenko and
Gabrielov introduced a notion, that of the real degree of a projection
map, that  can give a  non-trivial lower bound  on the number  of real
solutions to some systems of polynomial equations.

<P>

In this  talk, I  will describe this  idea of Eremenko  and Gabrielov,
give some  applications, and discuss  its limitations. In  addition, I
will show how this degree may be computed for some projections of some
toric varieties.
