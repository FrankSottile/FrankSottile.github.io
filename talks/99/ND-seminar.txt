Non-commutative Pieri operators on posets

  Many enumeration problems in algebraic combinatorics lead to
quasi-symmetric generating functions, for example Schur functions,
P-partitions, and Stanley symmetric functions.  Some of these have been
shown to have interesting algebraic properties, most notably the Hopf
structures of Ehrenborg's quasi-symmetric generating function for the flag
f-vector of a polytope and of Bergeron and Sottile's generating function
for decsents in a labeled poset.

  This talk will describe joint work with Bergeron, Mykytiuk, and 
van Willigenburg which gives a unified construction of many such 
quasi-symmetric functions.  Our approach is motivated by work on the
Schubert calculus for flag manifolds and uses representations of the algebra
of non-commutative symmetric functions generated by what we call Pieri
operators.
