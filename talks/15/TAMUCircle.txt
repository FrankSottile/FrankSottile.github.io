Texas A&M Math Circle

Frank Sottile

The Texas A&M Math Circle is in its fourth year of 
operation, during which we have gone from a fortnightly
after-school club of 10 students to a weekly activity 
of 50-60 in three classes.

While we have yet to converge on a stable organizational
strategy, we have had some progress towards sustainability
that I will report on.   This includes diverse funding 
sources, an organizing committee of five, and recruiting 
volunteers and activity leaders from our department, 
University, and other Texas Math Circles.   While every
math circle is different, we face similar challenges, and 
sharing of notes may help other organizers.
