Introductorial Talks

I "The Geometry of Grassmannians"

We define the Grassmannian, Stiefel coordinates, the Pluecker embedding, 
and its Schubert cells/varieties.  We then sketch the basics of Schubert 
calculus: Schubert classes in cohomology and Schubert's basis and duality 
theorems, define Littlewood-Richardson coefficients and prove the Pieri Rule.

IV: Advanced topics and preview of the mini-courses.
