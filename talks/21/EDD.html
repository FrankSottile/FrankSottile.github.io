Euclidean Distance Degree and Mixed Volume

The Euclidean distance degree (EDD) of a variety <i>X</i> in <b>R</b><sup><i>n</i></sup> measures the algebraic complexity of computing the point of <i>X</i>  closest to a general point <i>u</i> in <b>R</b><sup><i>n</i></sup> .  It is the number of critical points of the complexified distance function from <i>u</i> to <i>X</i> .  Known formulas involve polar classes of the conormal variety to <i>X</i>  or Chern classes of <i>X</i>. <P><br>&nbsp;In this talk, I will discuss formulas of a different character, when <i>X</i> is a hypersurface whose defining equation is general given its Newton polytope.  In this case, the EDD is shown to be the mixed volume of the critical point equations.  This uses Bernstein&apos;s Other Theorem, which is of independent interest.  We give an interesting closed formula for the EDD when the Newton polytope is a rectangular parallelepiped. This is joint work with Paul Breiding and James Woodcock.
