I was the second of five boys born to Sam and Nina (ne&eacute; Cantelmo) Sottile, who
were both Junior-High School teachers, and the first in their families to attend College,
he on the GI Bill (he was a member of the Army of Occupation in Germany during the Korean
 War) and she on a competitive scholarship from the Ford Motor Company for
 children of workers.
They met at <a Href="http://www.emich.edu/">Eastern Michigan University</a>, and raised
 five sons (I was number two and born in 1963 in Michigan).
My brothers are all quite accomplished.

<p>
While I was determined to be a scientist since about first grade
(and I had won a regional math contest for middle-school children at Eastern
Michigan University), my mathematical
interests came to the fore when I finished fourth in the
<a href="http://mmpc.svsu.edu/index.html">Michigan Mathematics Prize Competition</a> when
I took the contest on a whim in 1979/80.
I joined the top students to compete for Michigan in the Altantic Region Mathematics
League; these experiences helped me to decide to become a mathematician.

<p>
I attended the
<a href="http://honorscollege.msu.edu/">Honors College at Michigan State University</a> majoring in physics and
minoring in mathematics.
I supported myself throughout college on a creative mixture of scholarships and grants,
as well as tutoring, working at the
<a href="http://www.nscl.msu.edu/">National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory</a>, and
serving as an undergraduate TA for the Mathematics department.
I worked over 20 hours each week and had a Pell Grant.

<p>
I was fortunate to have extraordinary teachers and fellow students; they helped me to
have a deep and rewarding experience at Michgan State.
I won a
<a href="http://www.nsfgrfp.org/">National Science Foundation Graduate Research
Fellowship</a>, and a
<a href="http://www.winstonchurchillfoundation.org/">Churchill Scholarship</a> to
study at Cambridge when I graduated in 1985.
For some insight on my time there, here is a <a href="Axler_letter.pdf">letter</a> that Sheldon Axler
wrote to support my applications that year.
My life as a traveller also began while at MSU; each summer I went on a trip to the
American West, and when I graduated I visited a friend who was in the Peace Corps in
the Fiji Islands before I moved to Cambridge.

<p>
MSU prepared me well for Cambridge; I took the Mathematical Tripos Part III, receiving
Distinction.
I stayed at Cambridge to work on a Ph.D. under the direction of Graham Allan studying Banach
Algebras.
That did not go so well, due to my peripatetic ways, and I returned to the United States
to attend the
<a href="http://math.uchicago.edu/">University of Chicago</a>, where I met and married
<a href="/~sjw/">Sarah Witherspoon</a>, and
eventually received my Ph.D. in Mathematics under the direction of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Fulton_%28mathematician%29">William Fulton</a>.

<p>
Sarah and I had a series of jobs, working at the
<a href="http://www.math.toronto.edu/">University of Toronto</a>, then
<a href="http://www.msri.org/">Mathematical Sciences Research Institute</a>, then back at Toronto and
again at MSRI before spending 1.5 years at the
<a href="http://www.math.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin</a>.
Our daughter Maria was born just before we left Toronto.
After Wisconsin, I started a tenure-track job at the
<a href="http://www.math.umass.edu/">University of Massachusetts at Amherst</a>, but
Sarah did not yet have a permanent position.
Our son Sam was born while we lived in Amherst.

<p>
We finally left Amherst to assume faculty positions at
<a href="http://www.math.tamu.edu">Texas A&amp;M University</a>, where we
remain to this day.
Travel and family remain themes in our life;
Since leaving Amherst, we have spent time in Berkeley (I ran a semester at the <a href="http://www.msri.org/web/cms">MSRI</a> in 2004),
Munich (Sarah was a Humbolt fellow 2005-6)&mdash;I also sent 2 months in Paris that year and we lost my Father just before
I went to Paris.
I was in Minneapolis in Spring 2007(I was involved with the <a href="https://www.ima.umn.edu/">IMA</a> program on
Applications of Algebraic Geometry and the family joined for June and July),
Lausanne (Only me; I helped to organize a semester in Spring 2008 at the <a href="https://bernoulli.epfl.ch/">Bernoulli Centre</a>), and
Stockholm in Spring and Summer 2011 (<a href="http://www.mittag-leffler.se/">Institut Mittag-Leffler</a> for me and KTH for Sarah).
We were at MSRI in Berkeley again in Winter/Spring 2013, as Sarah was a Research Professor
with both research programs.
I spent the Autumn 2014 at the <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/">Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing</a>, and we took our
family (sans Maria, who is an Engineering Physics student at the <a href="https://www.ubc.ca/">University of British Columbia</a>) for the
academic year 2016&ndash;2017 in Toronto, me at the <a href="http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/">Fields Institute for Research
  in the 
  Mathematical Sciences</a>.<br><br>


In 2018, I spent April at the <a href="http://www.mittag-leffler.se/">Institut Mittag-Leffler</a>,
and then September and November at the <a href="https://icerm.brown.edu/">ICERM</a>, where I helped to organize the thematic semester on Non Linear
Algebra.
The year 2019 and beyond brought some changes.
Sam started at Michigan State studying Physics and Mathematics in the Autumn, about the
same time that Sarah became our department head, which limits her travel.
I was Berlin at the Freie Universit&auml;t Berlin as part of the 2019/2020 Winter Semester
<a href="http://ehrhart.math.fu-berlin.de/agplus/">Algebraic Geometry: Varieties, Polyhedra, Computation</a>,
and left nearly on the last plane before air traffic shut down due to CoViD.
Maria Graduated in Spring 2022, we lost my mother, and son Sam won a Goldwater Fellowship
The year 2022 ended with Sam winning a 2023&ndash;4
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BPIvKT-nIQTXcYLDqkCyt-VEanbyGXE6/view">Churchill Scholarship</a>.
View the
<a href="https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2023/msu-student-earns-churchill-scholarship">press release from MSU</a>.
He is the first second-generation Churchill Scholar.
Now that the academy is moving back to a new normalcy, this story should continue.
