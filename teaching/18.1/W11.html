<!-------------------------------------------------------------->
I will be putting up information about yout term paper soon.
Rough instructions are:
This should be about 2500-3000 words, or a comparable project in another medium.
The topic is your choice, but (like the book) it should involve a nontrivial amount of history and a nontrivial amount of mathematics.
Note that contemporary topics are OK.
If you already have ideas, or want to discuss this, feel free to write me (on Piazza, which I monitor every few hours).

<font color=maroon><h3>Week 11: 26 March 2017. </h3></font>
<ul>
  <li><font color=maroon><B>Opening Remarks:</b></font><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This week's readings are on various aspects of the complex numbers, and span several centuries.
  We already saw in the solution for the cubic how the complex numbers play a role even in finding real (as in real-number, but back then
  `actual') solutions.
  This is reprised in Chapter 14, which describes the rise of complex numbers in algebra, culminating in the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra,
  that every polynomial of degree <i>n</i> in one variable has <i>n</i> complex roots, counted with multiplicity.
  I cannot say that I agree with Stillwell's `reason' for this&ndash;that the complex numbers have two real dimensions, so that there is more
  room for zeroes to appear. (I do not see how this can be relevant for why the fundamental theorem of algebra holds in the algebraic
  closure of the field with 2 elements.)
  The middle parts of the chapter discuss how we came to view the complex numbers geometrically, as points in the plane.
  The mathematical meat in the chapter is his description of the proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra by d'Alembert&ndash;at least
  how d'Alembert's proof was made rigorous, using only Taylor series, Weierstra&szlig;'s Theorem that a continuous function on a bounded set
  takes a maximum and a minimim (This is referred to as the Bolzano-Weierstraa&szlig;'s Theorem in analysis classes), and a tiny bit of geometry.
  It is worth re-reading that part to understand it better, as the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra arises in the secondary curriculum.
  As someone who works in real algebraic geometry, I can confirm that the work needed to make Gau&szlig;'s proof rigorous is substantial.
  By now there are many, many proofs of this basic result.
  <br><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;
  Chapter 15 describes how the study of algebraic curves moved from the real plane to the complex projective plane, culminating in a
  topological understanding of algebraic curves by Riemann and others.
<font color=magenta>  There is a nice page about 
  <a href=:"https://jrh794.wordpress.com/2012/10/22/function-graphs-in-the-real-projective-plane/">curves in the real projective plane</a>
  thaty can help understand some of this.  (Note that one of the pictures there, the second one for the 1/(<i>x</i>+1)(<i>x</i>-1), is incorrect.</font>
  The topological description of Section 15.2 can be used to show that any sphere <i>S</i><sup><i>n</i>-1</sup> in
  <b>R</b><sup><i>n</i></sup> may be identified with  <b>R</b><sup><i>n</i>-1</sup> with a single point attached at infinity  &#8734; (the north pole
  of the sphere <i>S</i><sup><i>n</i>-1</sup>.)
  Riemann's topological description of algebraic curves coming from branch points, cutting, and glueing, continues to be a powerful technique to
  study topological spaces (google Surgery in topology, or look up handlebodies or `pair of pants decomposition').
  I also wish to point out that Riemann's decomposition enables us to understand the shape, for example, of a smooth cubic curve (as in
  Figure 15.11), while trying to understand how the donut maps 2 to 1 to the sphere with four branch points is quite a bit harder (I still
  cannot quite see this).
  <br><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;
   Chapter 16 continues this complex-number theme, but into the realm of complex functions.
   This is a great story; I am still amazed by the result that if a complex function has one derivative, then it has infinitely many
   derivatives and thus a power series expansion and thus....
   It begins with a discussion of the complex exponential, then mentions this above result (due to Cauchy) and the Cauchy-Riemann
   equations.
   The relation to Green's Theorem and fluid flow are also mentioned.
   These Cauchy-Riemann equations also arise in electro-magnetism and are one of the reasons (the other is the complex exponential) that
   complex functions continue to be used among electrical engineers.
   The last topic, on elliptic functions and lattices &Lambda; in <b>C</b>, along with moduar functions is a link back to number theory,
   which studies these objects.
   This may be revisited when we discuss more modern number theory in the waning weeks of this course.<br><br>

  <li><font color=maroon><B>Reading:</b></font>
   <ul>

    <li>
     Chapters 14, 15, and 16 of Stillwell.
     Re-read Sections 8.6 and 8.7 when reading 15.1, and try to understand Exercise 8.7.3.

     
    </li> 
 <!--    <li> 
    Skim the Wikipedia page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_of_pants_(mathematics)">Pair of pants (mathematics)</a>.
    It is worth knowing that this was named by British mathematicians, for whom `pants' does not refer to trousers, but rather to
    undergarments, which more closely resemble a sphere with three holes removed (one larger than the others).

 <li><font color=maroon><b>Assignment:</b></font> Due <font color=red>Tuesday, 3 April 2018.</font> (HW 12)<br>
   Email a .pdf to <A HREF="http://www.math.tamu.edu/~mehrzad/">Mehrzad Monzavi</A>

  <ol>
    <li>The exercises in Chapter 14 on the Fundamental theorem of Algebra do not touch on essential parts of that result.
        How the desire to show that all rational functions may be integrated in elementary terms was a motivation is interesting, and puts
        the technical topic of partial fractions from Calculus in an interesting light.<br>
        &nbsp; To that end, do exercises <font color=red>14.5.2</font>, <font color=red>14.5.3</font>, and <font color=red>14.5.4</font> on
        Bernoulli's undertstanding of the multiple angle formulas for the tangent function. 
    </li>
    <li>With Easter and your second paper, and the newness of branch points, I'll assign the three exercises in Section 15.2, which are
       mostly computational. That is, <font color=red>15.2.1</font>, <font color=red>15.2.2</font>, and <font color=red>15.2.3</font>.
       Possible sticking points in the first two are understanding what happens near 0 and near &#8734;.
    </li>
    <li>With this point in mind again, as well as hewing closer to Calculus and topics suitible for good high school students, I will assign the
       <font color=red>first two</font> exercises in Section 16.1 involving the complex exponential and Euler's equation
        <i>e</i><sup><i>i</i>&pi;</sup> + 1 = 0.
        The first two, <font color=red>16.1.1</font> and <font color=red>16.1.2</font> show how to deduce the form of the complex
           exponential from the power series for the exponential function.
         An easy justification for the validity of the series is that it converges absolutely.
<!--         The last two, <font color=red>16.1.3</font> and <font color=red>16.1.4</font>, which involve figuring out the values of
         <i>i</i><sup><i>i</i></sup>, are a little mind-bending, and you might feel some kinship 
         with Cardano, whose use of complex numbers caused him "mental tortures".
         I know from my experience giving <a href="https://www.mathcircles.org/">math circles</a> and
         <a href="http://www.mathteacherscircle.org/">Math Teacher's Circles</a> that these topics fascinate students and teachers.
         I discussed this at breakfast with my son a year ago when he took Calculus, with him asking about other bases and exponents, and our coming to
         the difference between the multiple values of rational 
         (finitely many values) versus irrational (infinitely many values) exponents for bases not equal to 1.-->
