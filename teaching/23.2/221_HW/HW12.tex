\item A 50kg woman carries a 6kg can of paint up a helical staircase the encircles a silo with a radius of 6m and a
  height of 30m.
  How much work does she do against gravity in accomplishing this task?\vspace{-2pt}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   
   
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item  Suppose now that the paint leaks out of the can at a constant rate (and that she trudges at a constant rate) so that
  1 kg is left when she gets to the top.
  How much work does she do against gravity in accomplishing this task?

\item For each of the following vector fields $\bfF$, determine whether or not it is conservative.
  If it is, find a potential function $f$ such that $\bfF=\nabla f$.\newline 
  (a)\ $\bfF(x,y)=(x^2+y)\bfi + (y^2+x)\bfj$

\item Suppose that $\bfF(x,y,z)$ is a vector function defined on $\RR^{3}\smallsetminus\{(0,0,0)\}$ whose direction at a point  is away
  from the origin and magnitude is proportional to the distance from the origin.

  Show that $\bfF$ is conservative.  \vspace{-2pt}
