   <H2>Some geometrical aspects of control points for toric patches</H2>

     G. Craciun, L. Garcia-Puente, and F. Sottile.

   <P>
    We use ideas from algebraic geometry and dynamical
    systems to explain some ways that control points influence the shape of a B&eacute;ezier 
    curve or patch. 
    In particular, we establish a generalization of Birch's Theorem and use it to deduce
    sufficient conditions on the control points for a patch to be injective.
    We also explain a way that the control points influence the shape via degenerations 
    to regular control polytopes.
    The natural objects of this investigation are irrational patches, which are 
    a generalization of Krasauskas's toric patches, and include B&eacute;ezier and tensor product
    patches as important special cases.
