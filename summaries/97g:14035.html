Let <I>V</I> be an <I>n</I>-dimensional complex vector space. The flag
manifold $<B>F</B>(<I>V</I>)$ of <I>V</I> parametrizes flags 
<CENTER>
 {0} &nbsp; = &nbsp; <I>F</I><SUB>0</SUB> \subset <I>F</I><SUB>1</SUB>
   \subset \cdots \subset <I>F<SUB>n</SUB></I>&nbsp; = &nbsp; <I>V</I>
</CENTER>
of linear subspaces. The cohomology
ring <I>H<SUB>n</SUB></I> of 
<B>F</B>(<I>V</I>) is generated by the Chern classes 
<I>x<SUB>i</SUB></I> = -<I>c</I><SUB>1</SUB>(\scr F<SUB>i</SUB>/\scr F\sb {i-1})$, where $\scr F\sb i$ is the bundle whose
fiber at a flag $F\sb \bfcdot$ is the space $F\sb i$. On the other hand, a
fixed flag $F\sb \bfcdot$ determines an integral basis for
$H\sb n$, indexed by permutations $w\in S\sb n$: this is given by the classes
$[X\sb w F\sb \bfcdot]$ of Schubert varieties $X\sb w F\sb \bfcdot$, formed
by flags with prescribed incidence relations with the elements of
$F\sb \bfcdot$.
<P>
The Schubert polynomial $\germ S\sb w$ in the variables $x\sb 1,
\cdots,x\sb {n-1}$ gives the Poincare dual to $[X\sb w F\sb \bfcdot]$ when
evaluated at $x\sb i=-c\sb 1(\scr F\sb i/\scr F\sb {i-1})$. These polynomials
can
be defined combinatorially as follows: first, define an operator
$\partial\sb {s\sb i}$ on the ring $\bold Z[x\sb 1,\cdots,x\sb n]$ by
$\partial\sb {s\sb i}
f=$ $(x\sb i-x\sb {i+1})\sp {-1} (f-f\circ s\sb i)$, where $s\sb i$ is the
transposition interchanging $x\sb i$ and $x\sb {i+1}$; then, extend the
definition recursively to all $w\in S\sb n$ by setting $\partial\sb {\text
{id}}=1$ and $\partial\sb w=\partial\sb {w s\sb a} \circ\partial\sb {s\sb a}$,
where $a$ is any index such that $w(a)&gt; w(a+1)$; finally,
$\germ S\sb w=\partial\sb {w\sp {-1} w\sb 0}(x\sb 1\sp {n-1} x\sb 2\sp {n-2}
\cdots
x\sb {n-1})$,
where $w\sb 0$ is the permutation defined by $w\sb 0(j)=n+1-j$ ($\germ
S\sb {w\sb 0}$ is the class of a point in $H\sb n$). By the interpretation of
$\germ S\sb w$ as basis elements for the cohomology of $<B>F</B>(<I>V</I>)$, there
exist integer constants $c\sb {uv}\sp w$ defined by the identity
$\germ S\sb u&#183; \germ S\sb v=\sum\sb w c\sb {uv}\sp w \germ S\sb w$
in $H\sb n$. In fact, the Schubert polynomials diagonalize the intersection
pairing over $<B>F</B>(<I>V</I>)$, so that $c\sb {uv}\sp w$ can be written out as a
certain triple intersection product of Schubert varieties.
<P>
Notwithstanding the rather explicit description of the polynomials
summarized above, no general combinatorial formula is known for the
constants $c\sb {uv}\sp w$. For the analogous problem for Schur
functions, the corresponding structure constants can be expressed
in terms of Young's lattice of partitions; according to the author of
the note under review, there should be a similar description of the
$c\sb {uv}\sp w$ in terms of counting paths of certain types in the
Bruhat order on $S\sb n$. In this well-organized article, he proves
a result in this direction: for $w\in S\sb n$, he obtains simple and
explicit formulas for the products $\germ S\sb w&#183; s\sb m(x\sb 1,\cdots,x\sb
k)$
and $\germ S\sb w&#183; s\sb {1\sp m}(x\sb 1,\cdots,x\sb k)$, where $s\sb m$ and
$s\sb {1\sp m}$
are respectively the complete and elementary symmetric polynomials of
degree $m$ in the variables $x\sb 1, \cdots,x\sb k$.
<P>
These formulas generalize Monk's formula (the case $m=1$) and
Pieri's formula (for the product of a Schur polynomial by a
symmetric polynomial). In fact, the result is proved by linking it to
Pieri's formula, after relating the geometry of $<B>F</B>(<I>V</I>)$ to that of
the Grassmannians $G\sb k V$ via the maps 
<B>F</B>(<I>V</I>)--> <I>G<SUB>k</SUB>V</I>
sending a flag $F\sb \bfcdot$ to $F\sb k$. The formulas were previously
stated (in a different form) by A. Lascoux and by
M.-P. Schutzenberger [C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris Ser. I Math. 294
(1982), no. 13, 447--450; MR  83e:14039].
<P>
The author also translates his formulas into the language of Bruhat
orders, proving a conjecture of
N. Bergeron and S. C. Billey [Experiment. Math. 2 (1993), no. 4,
257--269; MR  95g:05107],
and
generalizes the result to the product of a Schubert polynomial by any
hook Schur polynomial.
