            YMN 1996 Job Survey (revisited)

There have been 65 responses to the survey which ran in Concern's 
earlier this month.    While that number is too small to extract 
any meaningful conclusions, it has yielded some interesting anecdotes
(see other article in this issue), as well as the following hastily
compiled raw data:

65 Respondents; 

Their job status (for next year, as of survey):

18    have tenure track positions
4     have jobs in industry/government
21    have postdoctoral / temporary positions
2     have part time jobs
20    have yet to hear anything

Of those without permanent positions

7     have a three year position
4     have a two year position
5     have one year positions
5     were indeterminant


It is interesting to compare this with last year's survey.
Last year at this time there were 59 respondents, and 

	23    had tenure track positions
	3     had jobs in industry/government
	15    had postdoctoral / temporary positions
	1     had part time jobs
	16    had yet to hear anything

Thus there was an unemployment rate of 27 %, which is comparable to 
this year's surveyed rate of 30 %.  

Hopefully, I will get a flood of additional responses (I think that I
will need around 100 total to say anything meaningful) soon, so that we
can run an article in Concerns with a more detailed report.   I want to
thank all who responded, and ask anyone who has yet to do so to please
send in a survey.   Anyone should feel free to forward copies to their 
friends.   Below is a copy of the survey.

          Anecdotes from the 1995/6 YMN Job Survey

In the YMN job survey (see related article in this issue), I asked
respondents to include any information that they had on how their
colleagues were faring.  Below I have included these (edited)
comments.  To heighten interest, I have put them in order of the NRC
ranking of mathematics department (December 1995 NOTICES, pages
1538-1541), but have not indicated the actual rank, only the relative
rank.  I have also indicated the break between 'Groups':

Group I  (#'s 1.5 -- 40)
Group II (#'s 41 -- 79)
Group III  > 79

I hope you find this interesting.  If anyone wants to contribute to this
survey, please do so; I will still be collecting data for the next
week.  Later in June I will present the statistics, and then a
compilation of comments that were sent to me, which should make very
interesting reading.

Thanks to all of those who took the time to write the comments below.
I think that all of us appreciate this sharing of information.

Group I departments:

 Of about 10 I know who are graduating this year, 7 have 3yr/post-doc
positions, 1 has a 1-yr teaching position, and 2 are still looking.

 Of the 13 people here who made serious efforts at applying for jobs,
11 have them.  Besides a position at a major Hospital in Mathematical
Biology and two jobs in industry, the other 8 have positions at top 20
departments.  The two without jobs may stay here next year.
Basically, from the vantage point of this department, the job market
was good.  Note that no-one took a teaching job.

Of the people I know:
   2 have no job offers yet  (as of mid May)
   2 have 1 year jobs at top institutions (including myself)
   1 has a 2 year position at a Group I institution (April offer)
   1 has a 3 year position at a Group I institution (Feb offer) 
   1 has an excellent mathematical finance job 
        (his thesis was on mathematical finance)

 Of 5 graduating Ph.D.'s, two get tenure track jobs (At top 15
places!). Two have postdocs, and one is still looking. I am not
counted in these 5 because I am delaying the graduation to next year,
as is another student, because of the employment situation.

 We had 3 new PhD's applying for academic jobs. We have had 3 grads try
to go to Wall Street in the past year.  One loves it, one hates it,
and the 3rd is unemployed, as far as I know.

  I have accounted for 17 graduating PhDs that have made
an attempt at finding a job.  Nine have post-docs, three have
other academic jobs, one has a government job, and one has an
actuarial job.  Two have offers, but have not accepted a job yet.
One does not yet have any offers.

 Of the five students on the job market this year from our Applied
Mathematics Department, only two have positions at this time (one
tenure track, one postdoctoral).

 Three Ph.D.'s from here went to the NSA.  One of these had one other
offer, I don't believe that the others had any.  Of the three
postdocs, I have a tenure track position, one has accepted a second
postdoc, and at last report the other did not yet have a job.
Finally, a number of people at here are leaving the Ph.D. program,
getting Master's degrees and going into the business world--actuarial
work, finance and computer related.

 At least 3 new PhDs here got good 2-3 year postdocs.  I'm pretty worn
out by my 7th search in 8 years, which has been unsuccessful so far .

  Things are pretty bad.  We were extremely fortunate to have 3 NSF
postdoc recipients this year and one other person with a tenure-track
offer.  We had 12 who were looking for jobs, with 9 or 10 actively
seeking employment.  Somehow, a 40-44% placement rate doesn't seem too
great.


Group II departments:

  I think the job market stinks.  There are about 8 PhD students and 2
post docs in my department who are on the market.  One has a tenure
track position, one had an interview (but turned down a multi-year
teaching contract for 5-6 courses a semester, as the pay was not much
more than a graduate student's salary), and none of the rest have
heard anything positive.  Of the 7 graduate students, 4 have already
defended their PhD's.

  Of the 5 people I know who are graduating PhDs this year, all have
found employment as postdocs.

  Currently of five graduating PhD's here, two have tenure track
positions, one has taken a two-year visiting position, and two are
still looking.
 
  Of the four post-docs from here looking for jobs, only one has found a
permanent position thus far.

  Of 6 graduating PhD's from here, 1 has a tenure-track job, 1 has a
two-year post-doc, 1 has a three-year non-renewable position, one is
still looking for an academic job, and two plan to go into
non-academic jobs (one publishing, one a statistical company).

  As far as I know, I am the only one of the six people graduating here
Ph.D.s this year that has a definite commitment for the fall.  Others
have had interviews, but no offers as of yet.


Group III departments:

  Of the 3 people here who are finishing their PhD's and looking for
jobs, I am the only one who has a job as of yet.  The best
mathematician of the among us with the most research potential has had
1 phone interview and no-on site interviews!  He did not apply to as
many liberal arts colleges as I did.

  Of the 4 graduating new Ph.D.'s - two of us received offers from
academic institutions whith one accepting a position in industry
instead.  The two who did not receive offers are applying to community
colleges.  Also, two people who had graduated in 1994 and had tenure
track positions were back on the job market this year.  They hated the
jobs they had due to location, or the covert political game playing at
their institution.  They both accepted new tenure track positions.

  Of the two graduating PhD's here, both have tenure track positions.

  Of the three Ph.D.'s granted here this year, one has a tenure track
position, one is working part-time (largely due to the fact that she
is part of a two body problem), and I have secured a part-time job.
