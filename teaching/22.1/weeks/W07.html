<font color=maroon><h3>Week 7: 1 March 2022. </h3></font>
<ul>
  <li><font color=maroon><B>Opening Remarks:</b></font>
  
    &nbsp; &nbsp; Do think about your <a href="../Second_paper.html">second paper</a>.
    Actually, do more than merely think this through, but start your planning, as the deadline will creep up on you.
  <br>

   &nbsp; &nbsp; Our readings this week concentrate on the Calculus, continuing from last week.
  Chapter 10 in Stillwell's book covers many of the topics that are taught in the Calculus, as well as quite a lot about formulas involving
  infinite processes, including infinite sums and infinite products.
  There is also an historical perspective on the Calculus, which you see starts before Newton, and continues until the 18th century, which we will 
  eventually get to.
<!--  A less scholarly, but more entertaining perspective on some figures from this period is provided by our friend Bell.-->
  For those of us who teach or will teach calculus, this additional material should be helpful in giving us, if not our students, some perspective on
  the material and the times of its development.  
  </li>

  <li><font color=maroon><B>Reading:</b></font>
  <ul>

    <li>Chapter 10  in Stillwell's book.</li>

<!--     <li>Chapters six and seven in Bells's "Men of Mathematics" on Newton and Leibnitz.   Some of this is entertaining.</li>-->

    <li>J. V. Grabiner, <a href="../../20.1/629/pdfs/Grabiner.pdf">"The Changing Concept of Change: The Derivative from Fermat to
	Weierstrass"<a>, 
         Mathematics Magazine 56 (1983) 195&ndash;206.<br>
    I met Judy Grabiner in graduate school (her husband was a mathematical friend of my then Ph.D. advisor, Dr. Graham Allan at Cambridge),
	   and later her son was a postdoc with me at the MSRI in 1997.
	   I have found her articles on history of mathematics to be interesting reading, and I
    hope that you will like this one from 37 years ago.</li>

    <li>Watch the entertaining Numberphile video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-I6XTVZXww">1+2+3+...</a>.
       <!-- I will walk you through a correct derivation of this later.--></li>

    <li>Look up some sources about logarithms.  What were they used for?  Who invented them? <br>
        Up until the 1970s logarithms were commonly used as a shortcut to multiplication, because the logarithm turns multiplication (hard)
        into addition (easy).  (For those who have had modern algebra, this is because the logarithm function is a group isomorphism from the
        multiplicative group of the positive real numbers to the additive group of the real numbers.)<br>
        When I was a student in high school, they had just stopped teaching logarithms as a tool for calculation.
        Perhaps more interesting is that our sensory perceptions, specifically hearing and sight, are on a logarithmic scale.
        (As are the scales for loudness and Earthquake strength.)
        You might want to think about that as you look up material and do the homework problem on the distribution of data (Benford's Law).
    </li>

   </ul>
  </li>

  <li><font color=maroon><b>Assignment:</b></font> Due Monday, March 7.  (HW 7)<br>
   Here is a <a href="../HW/HW07.pdf">.pdf</a> and a  <a href="../HW/HW07.tex">LaTeX source</a> of the assignment.<br>
    You may also want the image files <a href="../HW/TenScale.pdf">TenScale.pdf</a>,
    <a href="../HW/NormalScale.pdf">NormalScale.pdf</a>, and  <a href="../HW/LogScale.pdf ">LogScale.pdf</a>. <br>
    <br>
    
  I will have a shorter assignments the next two weeks as several people
  are travelling in March, (Spring Breaks).
  <br>
   <b><font color=maroon>To hand in:</font></b>  <font color=red>We are using Gradescope for homework submission</font>.
  <ol>
    <li>Exercise 10.5.1 on page 192.   This shows a limitation of power series, which is clear if you look at the graph of the function
         <i>y</i>=&radic;<i>x</i>    (&nbsp; = &nbsp; <i>x</i><sup>1/2</sup> ). 
    </li>
    <li>Everybody loves the Fibonacci sequence (from a problem of Fibonacci about rabbits; it is interesting to look up the source.)
         Do the three problems in Section 10.6 in Stillwell about this interesting sequence.
    </li>
    
    <li>Do Exercise 10.7.3.  For this, use the formula for &zeta;(1-<i>s</i>) given at the bottom on page 196.
      You have to understand that &Gamma;(<i>n</i>) = (<i>n</i>-1)!, when <i>n</i> is an integer, such as 2, as well as the
      remarkable formula for
    &zeta;(2), as discussed at the start of Section 10.4. </li>
    
    <li>
      Write a coherent couple of sentences about at least one thing that is completely wrong with the Numberphile video.
      (For the critical thinkers, this is  easy.)<br>
      This should not be hard mathematically, but may cause some conceptual reorientation.
    </li>
    
    <li>I have adapted a project from Prof.&nbsp;Fulling about Benford's law and the
      <a href="../../20.1/629/logarithm.html">logarithmic scale</a>.
        Please do the exercise on that page.
    </li>
  </ol>
