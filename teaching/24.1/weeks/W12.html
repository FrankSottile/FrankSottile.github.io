<font color=maroon><h3>Week 12: 3 April 2024. </h3></font>

  <li><font color=maroon><B>Opening Remarks:</b></font>
  The rest of our book treats more modern topics in mathematics, focussing on the pure side and ignoring analysis (I think this reflects
  Stillwell's proclivities).
  This week, we will read about the beginnings of modern algebra, first the rise of group theory and then hypercomplex numbers.<BR><br>

  &nbsp; &nbsp;I found the exercises in the chapter on group theory to be a bit heavy; do read the chapter to get a feeling
  for the development of that topic and its birth in the theory of equations.
  Despite what Stillwell says, groups and solving equations do keep coming up in mathematics and its applications.
  I ran a conference at the <A href="https://icerm.brown.edu/">ICERM</a> on Galois groups in geometry and applications of
  mathematics in September 2020.
  Stillwell is right to note that the classification of finite groups is no longer a central theme in mathematics.<BR><br>

  &nbsp; &nbsp;
  The chapter on hypercomplex numbers shows how even if you wish something to be so, it may not be be true.
  Hamilton and others wanted to find a three-dimensional system of numbers that behaved like the real numbers
  (one-dimensional) and also complex numbers (two-dimensional).
  Instead, he found a four-dimensional system, called the quaternions, which almost behaves like the others, except that it is
  <i>noncommutative</i>.
  It is hard to overstate the importance of this discovery.
  You all know that many operations, from multuplying matrices to dressing one's self, depend upon the order in which they are applied
  (socks first and shoes second is quite different from shoes first and socks second!).
  This noncommutativity ended up being crucial for the development of quantum mechanics, which enables, for example, a
  computer smaller than the size of large building with the capabilities of the laptop I am typing on, not to mention the screen I
  am looking at, and etc. 
  Also, the unit quaternions form a multiplicative group which is equivalent to the group of rotations in <b>R</b><sup>3</sup>.
  Consequently, every person working in computer animation uses them, and their multiplication is hard-wired into all
  graphics chips in computers and cell phones.
  My knowing this led to my collaborating with two applied mathematicians on a paper inspired by a problem in determining
  the structure of a certain class of proteins, and then to one of my more influential papers in 20-teens.
  The last sections go into overdrive where he talks about the octonians.
  Read them, but I did not assign exercises from them.

  This week is supposed to be a bit light, to give you more time to finish the draft of your
  <a href="../Term_paper.html">term paper</a>.
  </li>

 <li><font color=maroon><B>Reading:</b></font>

<ol>
  <li>
    Chapters 19 and 20 in Stillwell.
  </li>
 <!--  <li>
   Bell's Men on Mathematics Chapters on Galois, Cayley, and Hamilton.
  </li>  -->
</ol

 </li>

 <li><font color=maroon><b>Assignment:</b></font> due Tuesday 9  April 2024. (HW 12)<br>
   Here is a <a href="../HW/HW12.pdf">.pdf</a> and a  <a href="../HW/HW12.tex">LaTeX source</a> of the assignment.<br>
   <font color=magenta>No group assignment this week:</font> Between finishing the draft of you;r term paper and the
   upcoming peer review, I want to go a bit lighter on you.
 <b><font color=maroon>To hand in:</font></b>  <font color=red>We are using Gradescope for homework submission</font>.
 
   <ol>
     <li>Do exercises 19.1.2, 19.1.3, 19.1.4, and 19.1.5.  Each is a single-step deduction from the previous; I am hoping
     this is not too onerous.</li> 
     <li>Also do exercise 19.3.6.</li>
     <li>In Chapter 20, do the exercises 20.5.1, 20.5.2, 20.5.3,  and 20.5.4. </li>

  </ol>
