<H2>Common transversals and tangents to 
   two lines and two quadrics in <B>P</B><SUP>3</SUP></H2>

    Gabor Megyesi, Frank Sottile, and Thorsten Theobald.

<P>
We solve the following geometric problem, which arises in several
three-dimensional applications in computational geometry:
For which arrangements of two lines and two spheres in <B>R</B><SUP>3</SUP>
are there infinitely many lines simultaneously transversal to the two
lines and tangent to the two spheres?
<P>
We also treat a generalization of this problem to projective quadrics:
Replacing the spheres in <B>R</B><SUP>3</SUP> by quadrics in projective space
<B>P</B><SUP>3</SUP>, and fixing the lines and one general quadric,
we give the following complete geometric description of the set of (second)
quadrics for which the 2 lines and 2 quadrics have infinitely many
transversals and tangents:
In the nine-dimensional projective space <B>P</B><SUP>9</SUP> of quadrics,
this is a curve of degree 24 consisting of 12 plane conics,
a remarkably reducible variety.
