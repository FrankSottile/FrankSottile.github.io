   This is a <font color=matoon>W</font> class, and one way that we fulfill that
   attribute is by writing papers.
   There will be two papers for this class.  
   The first will be on a topic related to the book <i>Flatland</i> by Edwin Abbott Abbott,
   and the second will be either
   I will give more information in the second half of the semester, in general, I urge
   creativity.<br> 

   <font color=maroon size=+1>Second paper</font>:&nbsp; This is to be either
   Historical/Expository or Mathematical.
   By Historical/Expository, I mean an exposition on a topic from the class, on a historical
   figure, or on the evolution of an idea. 
   Our book is full of a lot of additional material which can help you get started.
   A mathematical paper should involve the exposition of a significant result
   that is interesting. 
   Proofs, definitions, ilustrataions, etc. need to be included when appropriate.
   See <a href="#choiceOfTopics">Notes on choice of topic</a> below for more information,



   <font color=maroon size=+1>Flatland</font>:&nbsp;
   The book <i>Flatland</i> is a classic that has piqued the imagination of readers for 130
   years.
   I want you to write a paper inspired by <i>Flatland</i>; there are many
   possible and legitimate directions to take.
   Simplistically (for the purpose of this paragraph), <i>Flatland</i> is both a social satire
   and an exploration of the meaning of space and dimension.
   One direction that you could take is to compare it to other well-known satires, either
   modern or classical, or both.
   You could use it as a <i>point de d&eacute;part</i> to discuss education, or class, or
   education of Women in either Victorian England or contemporary US or elsewhere.
   You could explore its mathematical aspects, or mathematics that it touches on (geometry in
   higher-dimensional space).
   <i>Flatland</i> has inspired a lot of other works, including other books, movies, and 
   articles, you could write about some of these, or about its affects on how people think.
   It is possible to argue a line from <i>Flatland</i> to special and general relativity.
   You could write additional chapetrs/sections for <i>Flatland</i>.
   The possibilities are limited only by your imagination.<br>
   I will expect multiple sources in addition to the book <i>Flatland</i>, and solely on-line
   sources will not cut it, unless you can make a good argument.

<ul>

 <li> Each paper should exceed <font color=red>five pages and</font> 1500 words.
      You will need at least this much in order to do your topic justice.
      In past semesters, I have found that shorted papers are often too sketchy to 
      receive high marks.  If you happen to do an excellent job with fewer words,
      I could lighten this requirement, the standards will be quite high for that.
 </li>

 <li> Papers will be marked out of 160 points, with 10 points for timely and complete
       submission of topic and sources, 30 for the rough draft, 20 for the peer-review,
       and 100 for the final product.
 </li>
 
 <li> <b>Topic and sources:</b>  Give a (preliminary) title, and 
        a short (2 sentences to 1 paragraph) description of your topic, e.g. an abstract.<br>
        &nbsp;  &nbsp; <font color=blue>Historical/Expository</font> require multiple sources,
         severeal of which must be longer than the paper itself.  
        I want to see at least one source that is not a web page.
        Remember that Web items usually have authors and titles, not just URLs, and need to be
         cited accordingly. 
         (Giving the date of access is also considered desirable, since the Web 
           changes constantly.)<br>
        &nbsp; <font color=blue>Mathematical</font> papers need not have sources, if it is
        self-contained, <b>but</b>
        they would be improved by your knowing something of the context.
        In fact an important part of the mathematical paper will be its introduction (for
        context if that is warranted) and the clarity/justification of any definitions.
 </li>

 <li> <b>Draft:</b> This will be handed in to Frank, who will look at them and
        make some comments.  While they need not be in final form,  they should be complete,
        and will be marked on that basis.
 </li>

 <li> <b>Peer Review:</b> We will spend one day of class time working in small groups to read
     and discuss your writing.
     Your drafts must also be handed in to members of your group.
 </li>

<li> Here is an approximate breakdown:


&nbsp;&nbsp;<table border=10pt>
<tbody><tr><th>Criterion</th><th>Expository</th><th>Mathematical</th></tr>

<tr><td>Choice of topic</td><td>5%</td><td> 5%</td></tr>

<tr><td>Correctness and depth</td><td>25%</td><td>50%<td></tr>

<tr><td>Exposition</td><td>35%</td><td>20%</td></tr>

<tr><td>Mechanics (punctuation, etc.)</td><td>25%</td><td>20%</td></tr>

<tr><td>References</td><td>10%</td><td> 5%</td></tr>

<!-- Re balance these: Topic 5%, Correctness and Depth 25%, Exposition 35%, References 10%, --
  -- Mechanics 25%  -->

<li> Don't expect perfect scores.  In serious writing the threshold of 
      perfection is infinite. 
</li>

<li><b>A note on Plagiarism:</b> 
   Finding information in books or on the Internet is praiseworthy; lying (even
    by silence) about where it came from is academic dishonesty. 
   Whenever you copy from, or "find the answer" in, some other source, 
   give a footnote or reference. Otherwise, you are
   certifying that it is your own work.

<ul>
 <li> Any "major exercise" or "project" from the textbook is allowable, 
  with the qualifications below.
 </li>

 <li>
   You can choose a topic from outside the book's lists, but it would be 
   prudent to consult me about it first.
 </li>
 <li> In Ch. 1, major exercise 4 is harder than it looks.  I'll accept a paper  
   that does 2 of the 3 parts (e.g., assumes (a) and uses it to prove (b) and 
   (c)).
 </li>
 <li> Poject 5 in Ch. 1 (Morley's theorem) to be 
   historical.  (The solution is hard to work out but easy to find on the 
   web.)  So, put some history into it.  (One paper found and compared two 
   proofs.)   I would shy away from this topic.
 </li>
 <li>Ch. 1, project 13:  Beware that Russell has been misquoted here (and 
   many other places).  The correct quotation, which has different 
   connotations, is <a href="http://calclab.math.tamu.edu/%7Efulling/m467/russelltoil.txt">here</a>.
 </li>
 <li> In Ch. 2, regular exercises 14, 15, 16, and 19 are "major" 
   in my opinion  (hence suitable for papers).
 </li>
 <li> In Ch. 3, major exercise 6 is quite long.   Part (a) alone (done 
   well) makes a good 5-page paper.
 </li>
 <li> All exercises in Ch. 7 are considered "major".
 </li>
 <li> All essay topics in Ch. 8 are considered "major" (but some may also be 
   "historical"; consult me if you're not sure).
 </li>
</ul>

</li><li> These major papers should be individual work. (The "Joint work" 
policy is not a license to turn in a paper that is a clone of someone 
else's.)  Exception:  Two (or more) different papers on closely related 
topics that form a single project, with 
a different author taking primary responsibility for each.  (Example: 
Exercises 5-8 of Chapter 4, pp. 202-205.  Or regular exercise 14 and 
major exercise 3 in Chapter 2.  Or essays 2 and 18 in Ch. 8.)
</li>
