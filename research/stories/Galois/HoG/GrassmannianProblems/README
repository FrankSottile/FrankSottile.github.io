GrassmannianProblems/

  We list all simple Schubert problems on small Grassmannians 
sorted by their numbers of solutions.

SimpleProblems.maple
   This file takes as (hard-coded) input a pair k,n and creates a 
   file  Gk.n.problems

   That file contains a list Data, sorted in increasing order by
   intersection number.   The data for an individual simple
    Schubert problem has the form:

       [77, [[2, 1, 0], [1, 1, 0], 7]]
        ^        ^          ^      ^
        |         \         |    The number of simple Schubert conditions
    Intersection   \        |           used in this problem
      number      Pair of partitions
                  defining the simple
                  Schubert problem
