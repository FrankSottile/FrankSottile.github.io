<H2>Scientific Overview:</H2>

<P>
<font size=+1>
Schubert calculus originally meant the calculus of enumerative geometry, which
is  the  art of  counting  geometric  figures  determined by  given  incidence
conditions.   This was  developed in  the 19th  century and  presented  in the
classic  treatise  "K&auml;lkul  der  abz&auml;hlanden  Geometrie"  by  Herman  
C&auml;ser
Hannibal  Schubert  in  1879.   Schubert, Pieri,  and  Giambelli  subsequently
developed algorithms to solve enumerative geometric problems concerning linear
subspaces of vector spaces, which we  now understand to be computations in the
cohomology ring of a Grassmannian.   Their vision and technical skill exceeded
the foundations of this subject, and Hilbert, in his 15th problem, asked for a
rigorous foundation.   This was largely completed by the middle
of the 20th century, a centerpiece being the cohomology of Grassmannians.

<P>
By the 1950's it was discovered  that the cohomology ring of the Grassmannian,
with its  natural geometric  Schubert basis, was  essentially the same  as the
algebra  of  symmetric  functions,  with  its Schur  basis.   These  are  also
essentially the same  as the representation ring of  the general linear group,
with its basis of irreducible Weyl modules.  In particular, the multiplication
in  the   geometric  Schubert  basis   of  cohomology  was  governed   by  the
combinatorial Littlewood-Richardson rule (which was only proved in the 1970's).
These Schubert  classes correspond to Schubert varieties  in the Grassmannian,
and  Chevalley  showed  how  there  are natural  Schubert  varieties  for  any
algebraic homogeneous space, thus pointing  out a deep connection to algebraic
groups.  In the last 20 years, the  Schubert calculus has come to refer to the
study of  the geometric, combinatoric,  and algebraic aspects of  the Schubert
basis  in  various  cohomology settings,  and  its  relation  to the  rest  of
mathematics.

<P>
The past ten years have seen an explosion of progress in the subject.  A major
impetus for this resurgence was a meeting at Oberwolfach in 1997 at which some
people  from combinatorics and  geometry met  each other  for the  first time.
Since then,  there has been a  flood of important  work in this area  by Buch,
Eremenko-Gabrielov, Knutson-Tao,  Vakil, Knutson-Miller-Shimozono and many, many
others.  For example, 
Coskun    recently    announced    a    solution    to    the    long-standing
Littlewood-Richardson   problem  for  the   quantum  cohomology   of  a
Grassmannian.  
This meeting at Banff in 2007, 10 years after the Oberwolfach meeting, 
is intended to assess this recent progress  and chart the  course for  the next
decade.
