Description of session:

Algebraic geometry, the geometric study of polynomial equations, is a 
well-established field in pure mathematics that has recently begun
to find many, often unexpected applications in the rest of science and
technology, including engineering, computer science, statistics, biology, 
and chemistry.   This trend of algebraic geometry with a view towards 
applications, is succinctly  as Applicable Algebraic Geometry.   This
is the part of algebraic geometry that was seen at the 2006-7 topical 
year at the IMA on applications of algebraic geometry, and at a summer 
school the organizers ran in 2007.

   Texas has a concentration of researchers, including many students 
and postdocs, who work on applications of algebraic geometry, or more 
generally applicable algebraic geometry.  Because of the local interest 
in this topic, we propose to organize a special session on Applicable 
Algebraic Geometry at the Fall 2009 AMS Central Section Meeting 
at Baylor University in Waco, TX.
