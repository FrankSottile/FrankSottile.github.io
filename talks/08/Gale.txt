Gale duality for complete intersections

Frank Sottile
Texas A&M University

Gale duality for polynomial systems is an elementary
reformulation of a system of polynomial equations as
a system of equations involving rational master functions
in the complement of a hyperplane arrangement. Some
properties of the original system are easier to understand
in the Gale dual system. In this talk, I will describe
this Gale duality, look at some examples of this
construction, and give some elementary consequences.
This is joint work with Frederic Bihan.
