Algebraic Aspects of Periodic Operators

Frank Sottile  I: Background

Natural questions concerning the spectra of operators on periodic
graphs, including tight-binding models in quantum mechanics, are
expressed in terms of module endomorphisms and polynomials.
Hence these problems are amenable to study using ideas from
commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.  This is a new
application of algebra with interesting and consequential open
problems.  We will present the background, introduce the basic
ideas and questions in this area, and present problems that are
ripe for further study by the participants.
