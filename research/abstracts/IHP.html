<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; 
    Understanding,  finding, or  even deciding  the existence  of real
solutions to  a system of equations  is a very  difficult problem with
many applications.  While it is hopeless to expect much in general, we
know  a surprising  amount  about these  questions  for systems  which
possess   additional  structure.   Particularly   fruitful---both  for
information  on  real solutions  and  for applicability---are  systems
whose additional  structure comes from geometry.   Such equations from
geometry for which we have information about their real solutions will
be the subject of this short course.

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; 
   We  will focus on  equations from  toric varieties  and homogeneous
spaces, particularly  Grassmannians.  Not only is much  known in these
cases, but they encompass some  of the most common applications.   The
results we discuss may be grouped into three themes:<BR>
 &nbsp; (1) Upper bounds on the number of real solutions.<BR>
 &nbsp; (2) Geometric problems that can have all solutions be real.<BR>
 &nbsp; (3) Lower bounds on the number of real solutions<BR>
Upper  bounds as  in  (1) bound  the  complexity of  the  set of  real
solutions---they are  one of  the sources for  the theory of o-minimal
structures.  Lower
bounds as  in (3) give an  existence proof for  real solutions.  Their
most   spectacular  manifestation   is  the   non-triviality   of  the
Welschinger invariant, which was computed via tropical geometry. 


<p>
The book has three parts, grouped by geometry:

I)   Overview        (Chapter 1)<BR>
II)  Toric varieties, upper and lower bounds (Chapters 2--6)<BR>
