The Algebra-Geometry Dictionary

   Algebraic geometry is the study of geometric sets,
called varieties, defined by algebraic (polynomial) 
equations.  The equations induce algebraic structure on 
varieties.  This core mathematical subject derives its 
power and applicability from the interplay of the algebraic 
structure with the geometry of varieties.   This interplay 
leads to a precise dictionary between algebraic and 
geometric concepts.

  In these lectures, I will introduce some of the basic
definitions in algebraic geometry with the intention  
of explaining the dictionary between algebra and 
geometry that underlies the subject.
