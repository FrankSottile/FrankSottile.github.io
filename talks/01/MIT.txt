The Hopf algebra of permutations of Malvenuto and Reutenauer

Gessel's enumerator of posets partitions may be seen as a
morphism  from a Hopf algebra of labeled posets to the
Hopf algebra of quasisymmetric functions. This map factors 
through a third Hopf algebra consisting of permutations, 
which was introduced by Malvenuto and Reutenauer.  This 
talk will describe the structure of this Malvenuto-Reutenauer 
Hopf algebra in detailed combinatorial terms. This description is 
obtained through careful analysis of the weak Bruhat order on the 
symmetric groups and their subsets of shuffles.

This is joint work with Marcelo Aguiar.
