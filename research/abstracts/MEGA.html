<H2>Real enumerative geometry and effective
    algebraic equivalence
</H2>

 We study when a problem in enumerative geometry may have all of its
solutions be real and show that many Schubert-type enumerative problems on
some flag manifolds can have all of their solutions be real.  Our particular
focus is how to use the knowledge that one problem can have all its
solutions be real to deduce that other, related problems do as well.  The
primary technique is to deform intersections of subvarieties into
simple cycles.  These methods also give lower bounds on the number of real
solutions that are possible for a particular enumerative problem.
