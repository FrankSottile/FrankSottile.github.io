Title: New Fewnomial Upper Bounds from Gale Dual Polynomial Systems

Abstract:

 In 1980, Askold Khovanskii established his fewnomial bound for the number of
 real solutions to a system of polynomials, thereby showing that the complexity
 of real solutions to a polynomial system depends upon the number of monomials
 and not the degree.  This fundamental finiteness result in real algebraic
 geometry was proven by induction on the number of monomials and the bound is
 unrealistically large.

 I will report on joint work with Frederic Bihan on a new fewnomial bound which
 is substantially lower than Khovanskii's bound.  This bound is obtained by
 first reducing a given system to a Gale system, which comes from the Gale dual
 to the exponent vectors in the original system, and then bounding the number of
 solutions to a Gale system.  Like Khovanskii's bound, this bound is the product
 of an exponential function and a polynomial in the dimension, with the
 exponents in both terms depending upon the number of monomials.  In our bound,
 the exponents are smaller than in Khovanskii's.
