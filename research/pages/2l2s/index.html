<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Summary.</B></FONT>
Given two general lines and two general quadrics in <B>P</B><SUP>3</SUP>,
there are exactly <B>8</B> lines that simultaneously meet the two given lines
and are tangent to the two quadrics.
Call these 8 lines common transversals and tangents.
Here, we are concerned with the situation when the lines and quadrics are not
generic; that is when there are infinitely many such common transversals and
tangents.
Specifically, which arrangements of lines and quadrics have infinitely many
common transversals and tangents.

<P>
Our approach is to fix two (skew) lines and a quadric, and then describe the
common transversals and tangents in this case.
For example, the picture above on the left displays the 
<FONT COLOR="#88EE88">lines</font> transversal to the 
<FONT COLOR=RED>red</FONT> line and to a line at infinity, and tangent to the
<FONT COLOR="#EE9900">sphere</FONT> as shown.
The curve of tangency is drawn in <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">blue</FONT>.

<P>
Having done that, we then describe which second quadrics have the same set of
common transversals and tangents.
For example, the picture on the right shows the same sphere, common
transversals and tangents, and red line,
<I>and</I> it shows a hyperboloid of two sheets tangent to every one of the
common transversals and tangent to the sphere.
(Here the sphere is hidden in the back of the main figure.)

<P>
We study the fascinating geometry behind this in the paper of the same name.
Briefly, fixing the two lines and the first quadric, the space of second
quadrics for which there are infinitely many common transversals and tangents
is a curve in the <B>P</B><SUP>9</SUP> of quadrics that is remarkable
reducible---it is the union of 12 plane conics!
This page is dedicated to providing computer algebra scripts used to prove
these results and displaying the many (very intriguing) pictures we have
generated of this situation.
