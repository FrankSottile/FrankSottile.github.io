   The Shapiro conjecture for Grassmannians (now a
Theorem of Mukhin, Tarasov, and Varchenko) asserts 
that all (a priori complex-number) solutions to 
certain geometric problems from the Schubert calculus 
are actually real.  Their proof is quite remarkable, 
using ideas from integrable systems and representation
theory.
Despite these advances, the full Shapiro conjecture 
remains open with several interesting and not quite 
understood generalizations that are likely true.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; 
    This talk will introduce the Shapiro conjecture
for Grassmannians and its links to subjects from 
combinatorics to complex analysis to control theory and 
then give an idea of its proofs and consequences, and 
its extensions.
