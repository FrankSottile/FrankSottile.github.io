###### Symmetric functions for graphs from chains of length 2. ######
Paritions
[c[[2]], c[[1, 1]]]
The lists in the folowing lines record the symmetric functions of the dual
 equivalence graphs.  They are pairs [i, coeffs], where i is the number of
 vertices in a graph and coeffs is the vector of Schur coefficients, where the
 order is the order of the partitions just given.
 [1, [0, 1]]
 [1, [1, 0]]
This computation took 0.12 seconds.
