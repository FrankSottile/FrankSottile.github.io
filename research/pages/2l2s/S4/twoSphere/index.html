<P> &nbsp; &nbsp; 
In the pictures below, the sphere in <FONT COLOR="#FFBB00">coral</FONT> is
the original sphere and the lines perpendicular to the <I>x</I>-axis and
tangent to this sphere are drawn in <FONT COLOR="#99FF99">light
blue-green</font>.
Each quadric in <font color=red>red</font>
is a member of one of the 
families of quadrics tangent to the same set of lines perpendicular to
the <I>x</I>-axis as the original quadric.
Of the 12 families given by our Theorem, only 4 contain real quadrics.
We display one real quadric from each family.
Linked pictures are to animated .gif files showing how the quadric moves in
the family.

<P> &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Each family may perhaps best be thought of as parameterized by the points on a
hyperbola with affine equation <I>ab</I>-1, with smooth quadrics corresponding
to the points in the affine plane, but two singular members given by the two
points at infinity.
Our parameterization runs along one branch of this hyperbola, from 
<I>a</I>=sqrt(5)-2 to <I>a</I>=sqrt(5)+2, avoiding, but approaching the
singular members. 

<P> &nbsp; &nbsp; 
These singular members are rank 2 quadrics with vertex either the <I>x</I>-axis
or the <I>y-z</I> plane at infinity (their zero set is two planes meeting
either in the <I>x</I>-axis or the <I>y-z</I> plane at infinity).
Either the two planes are real or they are complex conjugates.
Here, none of the singular members with vertex the <I>x</I>-axis consist of
two real planes; they are both complex conjugates.
On the other hand, 
Each of the singular members with vertex the <I>y-z</I> line at infinity
consist of two real planes.

<P> &nbsp; &nbsp; 
<FONT COLOR=RED>We have not yet generated movies of these families.
On the other hand, these families are each a single orbit of <B>R</B><SUP>x</SUP>,
the non-zero real numbers, which acts on <B>R</B><SUP>3</SUP> by scaling the
distance to the <I>x</I>-axis.
This observation leads to the conclusion about the limiting members of the
families.</FONT>

These pictures were drawn with Maple.
An initial precomputation with Singular
computed the families.  
We have Maple files that draw each of the pictures, 
(<A HREF="draw/a">NW</A>,
 <A HREF="draw/b">NE</A>,
 <A HREF="draw/c">SW</A>,
 <A HREF="draw/d">SE</A>)
<!--an a single file for <A HREF="draw/animate.maple">animating</A> the families,-->
and a file  <A HREF="draw/rotate.maple">rotates</A> the original sphere and
its transversal tangents.
