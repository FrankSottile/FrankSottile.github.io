\item {\color{Maroon}\bf Polya's Theorem.}  {\color{RoyalPurple}\sl All horses have the same color.}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  We prove that for each natural number $n$ if a herd of horses contains $n$ horses, then all the horses in that herd have the
  same color.

  {\color{Maroon}\sf Base case:}
   The case with just one horse is trivial. If a herd has only one horse, then clearly all horses in that herd have the same color.


   {\color{Maroon}\sf Inductive step:}
   Let $k\in \NN$ and assume that in any herd of $k$ horses, all the horses have the same color.
   Consider now a herd consisting of $k{+}1$ horses.

   First, exclude one horse from the herd.  The remaining $k$ horses form a herd, and by induction, they all have the same
   color.
   Likewise, exclude some other horse (not the same one who was first removed) and look only at the other $k$ horses.
   By the same reasoning, these too, must also be of the same color. Therefore, the first horse that was excluded is of the
   same color as the non-excluded horses, who in turn are of the same color as the other excluded horse. Hence the first
   horse excluded, the non-excluded horses, and last horse excluded are all of the same color.

   This completes the proof.\ \ $\Box$\bigskip

   {\color{blue}Analyze this proof of Polya's Theorem: determine if it is correct or not, and explain your analysis.}

\item Explore the divisibility by 3 of positive powers of 4.  (E.g. $4^n \mod 3$, for $n\in\NN$.)

\item Write a proof in paragraph form of the inequality

 \item{} Consider the sequence $\{a_n\mid n\in\NN\}$  defined by $a_1=1$, $a_2=3$ and for each $n\in \NN$,
           $a_{n+2}=3 a_{n+1}-2a_n$.
   Calculate the first eight terms of this sequence. 

   Conjecture a formula for $a_n$ and prove it using induction.

 \item{} Consider the sequence $\{a_n\mid n\in\NN\}$  defined by $a_1=a_2=1$ and for each $n\in \NN$,
           $a_{n+2}=\frac{1}{2}\left(a_{n+1}+\frac{2}{a_n}\right)$.
   Calculate the first six terms of this sequence.

   Prove, for all $n\in\NN$, that $1\leq a_n\leq 2$.
