<H2>Irrational proofs for two theorems of Stanley</H2>

  Matthias Beck and Frank Sottile

<P>
 We give new proofs of two theorems of Stanley on generating functions
 for the integer points in rational cones.
 One is Stanley's reciprocity theorem, relating the generating function at <b>x</b> and 
 1/<b>x</b>, and the second asserts that the generating
 function of the Ehrart quasipolynomial is a rational function with a nonnegataive
 numerator. 
 The proofs are based on elementary (primary school) counting afforded by irrational
 decompositions of rational polyhedra.
