Real Solutions to Polynomial Equations
--Frank Sottile, Texas A&M University

  Advances in theory and software have turned an
intractible problem---finding all (complex-number) 
solutions to moderately-sized systems of non-linear 
equations---into routine computation.  Related 
advances include a priori information on the 
meaningful real solutions and promising new algorithms 
that only compute the real solutions.  This poster
will summarize this work, which is important for
the applications of mathematics.
