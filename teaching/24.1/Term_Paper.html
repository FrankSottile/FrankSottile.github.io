<font color=maroon><h2>The term paper (due end of April)</h2></font>

  You will need to both email a .pdf to me at <TT><a href="mailto:sottile@tamu.edu">sottile@tamu.edu</a></TT>,
  and submit this to turnitin.com.  I will set that up later in the semeser.<br>

<hr>
This will be a fairly substantial paper.
It should include both non-trivial mathematics and non-trivial history.
I expect this to be well-researched with a number of sources, which should include some books
  and/or journal articles, as well as easier to get (and less reliable) on-line sources.
  This will be challenging, but using the TAMU library and its electronic resources, as well as libraries in your home town can be a help.
  (I have often experienced the power of the TAMU library; For example, once I needed to research a topic for a book I was writing, and I was
  able to get electronic versions of articles and one of the books I needed through TAMU libraries, which saved the  day for me.)
  Amazon is another quick source of books, and Dover is a source of often high quality books at very reasonable prices.<br><br>

      Here are two journals that have decent accessible articles, including some related to history:
         The Mathematical Intelligencer (published by Springer) and the American Mathematical Monthly (published by the Mathematical
         Association of America).  I am an editor for the latter, and have read it off and on since I was given a subscription in High
         school as a prize from a math contest.<br><br>

   <font color=red>A note about length:</font> You will need space to develop your ideas.
   I expect that it will be impossible to do this in a paper with fewer than 2000 words. <br><br>

   <font color=red>A note about formatting:</font>  Please use double (actually 1.5) spacing between the lines, so that I may scrawl my
    comments in the more relevant place.
    Also, please have a running head with your name on each page and page numbers, and a title.<br><br>
  <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

   While I expect that most of you will choose to write a paper, it is possible to fulfill this
   without writing a paper; a comparable project in another medium of the same quality would be appropriate.
   In one of Steve Fulling's classes, a student made a detailed time line for classroom use.  <!-- (See link to topics from his class below.)-->
   I can imagine, for example, a well-thought-out module about mathematics history relevant to a class you teach, say to
   fill the weeks bizarrely inserted between the end-of-year standardized exams and the end of the school year.
   (Everywhere else that has
   such leaving exams does them after classes end, so as to not waste classroom time.)

To help move this along, there are several parts of this that I'd like to have done by certain dates:

Here are some additional sources of information.
These are included not to delineate what you will write about, but to stimulate your imagination and curiousity.
<font color=red>I prefer students to write papers on different topics, and will post topics on
  the  <a href="Term_Paper_Topics.html">page</a>  as I hear from students.</font>

<ul>
  <li> The <a href="Term_Paper_Topics.html">list of topics</a> from my class from past years</li>

  <LI> Dr. Geller's list of example
      <a href="http://www.math.tamu.edu/~sue.geller/math629/papertopicsf05.html">term paper topics</a> 
<!--     (I do NOT require all the topics to be different.) -->
     I shall also steal these words of wisdom from her math 629 home page:
  <br>
     While a complete, in-depth analysis of the topic is not expected (that 
     would be a dissertation or book), a superficial discussion is not 
     sufficient. The term paper should be a thoughtful discussion of your 
     topic including the appropriate mathematics and history. I want to 
     know by reading the paper that you learned some things and thought 
     seriously about the topic.
  </li>
<!--  <li>Steve Fulling's list of <a href="http://calclab.math.tamu.edu/~fulling/m629/papertitles.html">Paper titles from previous years</a>.  </li>-->

  <li>Here are some topics that spring to mind.   I am free-associating, the lists of my predecessors may be a more sober place to begin.
   <ul>

     <li>The four color theorem.  This has an interesting story of its beginning (Francis Guthrie and Augustus De Morgan) through to the
         controversy of its computer-assisted proof.
     </li>

     <li>Euler's formula, which began in his investigation of graphs, and in its modern form (the Euler characteristic) is a cornerstone of
         topology and for surfaces is the same information as genus.
     </li>

     <li>Differential geometry.  The story from Gauss, who created this subject while surveying the Kingdom of Hanover,  to Einstein, who used
     it as the basis for general relativity, and maybe even to Perleman's proof of Thurston's geometrization conjecture. (There is a lot here).</li>

     <li>While on this topic, the story of the Poincar&eacute; conjecture, from Poincar&eacute; to Smale to Freedman to Thurston to Perleman
         is a possible story to learn about and discuss.</li>

     <li>The mathematical constant &pi; is forever interesting.   A topic that I like (I give talks on this) is why the four
	 measurements&ndash;circumference and area of a circle, and area and volume of a sphere&ndash;all involve the same constant &pi;.
	 <i>A priori</i> each gives a different definition of a constant, and it is a great theorem of Archimedes that these are the same
	 number.
     </li>

     <li>There is a lot more on &pi;.  The article
     <i>I Prefer Pi: a Brief History and Anthology of Articles in the American Mathematical
     Monthly</i> by the late Jonathan Borwein and Scott Chapman is a great place to begin with &pi; facts.  They have a book, which
     I think is available.
     </li>

     <li>More history of great Theorems: Attempts to prove Fermat's last Theorem led to many developments in Number Theory, and the
     beginning and end of that makes a great story.</li>
