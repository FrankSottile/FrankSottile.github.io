<H2>2.vi. Proof when <I>(m,p)=</I>(2,3)</H2>

As with the case of <A HREF="SectII.2.html#22">(<I>m,p</I>)=(2,2)</A>, we
have  a  <A HREF="http://www.maplesoft.com/">Maple V.5</A> script
which, when run, proves 
<A HREF="SectII.2.html#conj"><B>Conjecture 1</B></A> in the
case when <I>(m,p)=</I>(2,3).
Here is the <A HREF="computations/Theorems/Theorem24.maple">script</A>, and
here is its <A HREF="computations/Theorems/Theorem24.output">output</A>.
(The Maple V.5 script requires two additional scripts, 
<A HREF="computations/Theorems/SYMMETRIZE">SYMMETRIZE</A>, which computes the
primitive part of a symmetrization of a given polynomial and 
<A HREF="computations/Theorems/ELEMENTARIZE">ELEMENTARIZE</A>.
which converts symmetric polynomials into polynomials in the elementary
symmetric polynomials.)
<P>

&#160;&#160;
While the K6/2 300MHz processor we use requires only 14.6 seconds to run the
script, it took us several months of computer experimentation to create that
script. 
We originally tried to compute the discriminant in SINGULAR, using standard
algorithms to compute the discriminant of a polynomial system.
This did not work.
Later we found that Maple would easily compute a universal eliminant, and
then also the discriminant.
(Singular also does this with even more ease.)
This polynomial has degree 20 in the 4 parameters <I>s,t,u,v</I>  we used
and 711 terms.
We brazenly tried to show it is positive semidefinite (takes only
non-negative values on real parameters) by showing it was a sum of squares.
For this, we applied brute force techniques.
In the end, we wrote it as a sum of 14 symmetrized squares, in total a sum
of 232 squares.
<P>

&#160;&#160;
We remark that one cannot hope to write an arbitrary positive semidefinite
polynomial of this degree in 4 variables as a sum of squares.
The example here may be the largest `naturally occurring' polynomial shown
to be a sum of squares.
In <A Href="SectIII.7.html">Section 3.vii</A> we challenge the reader with
some larger candidates we have computed.
