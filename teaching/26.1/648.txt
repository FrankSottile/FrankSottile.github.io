Computational Algebraic Geometry

Winter 2026
Tu-Th 3:55-5:10 PM

   This course will cover the basics of computational algebraic geometry,
including the core algorithms in the subject, as well as introduce
some of the most common algebraic varieties which occur in applications.
We will gain familiarity with software for algebraic geometry, including
the systems Macaulay 2, Singular, Bertini, and HomotopyContinuation.jl.
Students will complete a final project in the subject which will be presented
to the class in lieu of a final exam.   Grading will be based on final projects
and some written/computer work through the term.

I hope to cover the following topics:

 - Algebraic-geometric dictionary
 - Resultants and elimination
 - Groebner bases, including algorithms based on Groebner bases
 - Solving polynomial systems symbolically.      
 - Some structural properties of algebraic varieties
 - Real root counting.  Sturm's theorem.  Fewnomial theory
 - Solving systems of polynomial equations using 
    numerical continuation
 - Certification of numerical solutions.  
 - Numerical algebraic geometry.  Witness sets and numerical 
     irreducible decomposition
 - Toric ideals
 - Toric degenerations and Khovanskii bases
