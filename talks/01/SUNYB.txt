The Malvenuto---Reutenauer Hopf algebra of permutations

Frank Sottile

The Solomon descent Algebra of the symmetric group is
a sub Hopf algebra of an algebra of permutation introduced
by Malvenuto and Reutenauer.  This algebra may be seen as 
a non-commutative version of the algebra of quasi-symmetric 
functions, and has applications to enumerative combinatorics.

This talk will describe the structure of this Malvenuto-Reutenauer
Hopf algebra in detailed combinatorial terms. This description is
obtained through careful analysis of the weak Bruhat order on the
symmetric groups and their subsets of shuffles.

This is joint work with Marcelo Aguiar.
