<H2>The special Schubert calculus is real</H2>

Frank Sottile

    <P>
    Fulton asked: `How many solutions to a problem of enumerative geometry
    can be real?'.
    In this paper, we consider problems of enumerating <I>p</I>-planes
    having excess intersection with general linear subspaces and show that 
    there is a choice of real linear subspaces osculating the rational normal
    curve so that all <I>p</I>-planes having excess intersection are real.
    This proves a special case of the conjecture of Shapiro and Shapiro.
