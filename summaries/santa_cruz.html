An intriguing problem in enumerative geometry is to decide how many
solutions to a given enumerative problem can be real. A problem is called
{\it fully real} if there are real conditions such that all figures
satisfying them are real. An example of a fully real problem is Bezout's
theorem. Indeed, given $X\sb 0$ consisting of $d$ real lines and $Y\sb 0$
consisting of $e$ real lines, such that $X\sb 0$ and $Y\sb 0$ meet in
exactly $de$ points. Then we find small deformations of $X\sb 0$ and $Y\sb
0$ to real curves $X$ and $Y$ that intersect in $de$ real points. Note that
it is important that the $de$ intersection points of $X\sb 0$ and $Y\sb 0$
are distinct, for then the intersections of small deformations are real
since two complex conjugate solutions must deform into a real double
point. For example if $X\sb 0 =\{ xy=0\}$ and $Y\sb 0 =\{x+y=0\}$, then we
can deform $X\sb 0$ to $X\sb t =\{xy=t\}$ for $t\geq 0$, and $X$ intersects
$Y\sb 0$ in two complex conjugate points for all $t\neq 0$. \par

In the present note some examples are given of fully real enumerative 
problems for which multiplicity--free deformations play a central role. 
Among these are the results of the author showing that Schubert--type 
enumerative problems involving lines in $\bbfP\sp n$ are fully real, 
and similar problems to which the author has extended these results. 
Also the proof of {\it F. Ronga, A. Tognoli} and {\it T. Vust} that 
the problem of the $3264$ conics intersecting $5$ general conics is 
fully real. This proof involves degenerate conditions with multiplicities.
<P>
The author mentions $4$ problems worth considering: 
<P>
Are there conditions on lattice polytopes $\Delta\sb 1, \dots \Delta\sb n$ 
in $\bbfZ\sp n$ which ensure the existence of real polynomials 
$f\sb 1, \dots , f\sb n$ with these polytopes as Newton polytopes, 
and such that all solutions to $f\sb 1=\cdots =f\sb n=0$ are fully real?<BR>

Are all Schubert type problems on flag varieties fully real, and if not, which ones are fully real? <BR>
Are all enumerative problems on spherical varieties fully real, and if not,
which ones are fully real? <BR> 
Which problems involving rational curves on a subvariety of $\bbfP\sp n$ of
fixed dimension and degree are fully real? The author has shown that all
such problems involving lines only are fully real.<br>
