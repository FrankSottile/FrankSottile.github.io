<H2>A geometric approach to the combinatorics of
    Schubert polynomials
</H2>

Schubert polynomials, which had their origins in the cohomology of flag
varieties, have recently been the subject of much interest in algebraic
combinatorics.  A basic open problem is to give a rule for multiplying two
Schubert polynomials, that is, find an analog of the Littlewood-Richardson
rule for Schubert polynomials.
We describe a geometric proof of an analog of Pieri's rule for Schubert
polynomials.  This was stated by Lascoux and Sch&uuml;tzenberger, who
suggested an algebraic proof.  Interpreting this formula geometrically
vexposes a striking link to the Littlewood-Richardson rule for Schur
polynomials, and indicates possible extensions.  While this approach uses
ideas and methods from algebraic geometry, the proofs involve little more
than elementary linear algebra.
