   <b>Abstract:</b>  &nbsp; 
The Schubert calculus concerns enumerative problems involving
linear objects -- for instance, to count the lines in space meeting
four given lines.   Over the complex numbers, Schubert provided the
answer to this (and many other related) problems in 1891.  What
might be said over the real numbers is of much recent interest.
The goal of this talk is to convey the basic notions and some recent
developments in this very active and fruitful subject.

   <b>Abstract:</b>  &nbsp; 
In mathematics it is often useful to approximate a function f on
a region <i>D</i> in <b>R</b><sup>2</sup> by a ``simpler'' function. A natural way to do
this is to divide D into triangles, and then approximate f on
each triangle by a polynomial function. A <b>C</b><sup><i>r</i></sup>-differentiable
piecewise polynomial function on <i>D</i> is called a spline.
Splines play a key role in geometric modeling, the finite element
method for solving PDE's, and in approximation theory. There is
also a great deal of interesting mathematical structure involved,
including commutative and homological algebra, geometry,
combinatorics and topology. I'll give a gentle overview of the
problem, with main focus an introduction to simplicial homology,
and discuss how Grobner bases and computational algebraic geometry
enter the picture.

   <b>Abstract:</b>  &nbsp; 
Many computational problems in geometric and solid modeling
can be reduced into relatively easily stated algebraic formulations.  As
people have sought to improve the robustness of these geometric
operations, greater attention has been focused on these algebraic
formulations, and on methods for precisely solving such problems.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; 
In this talk, I'll begin with a brief introduction to some of the
typical algebraic problems faced in geometric and solid modeling.  I'll
focus much of the discussion on the boundary evaluation problem for
computing results of Boolean combination of solid models, and how exact
computation is used to deal with these.  Finally, I'll talk about some
of the challenges faced when moving from more theoretical descriptions
of algorithms into practical implementations.

   <b>Abstract:</b> &nbsp; 
        The P=?NP problem has been with us since 1971 and remains
a guiding force behind theoretical computer science.  The question
involves a complexity class, called NP, which is comprised of hundreds
of algorithms from discrete optimization, number theory, and many other
areas.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
       We give a gentle introduction to this question and then move
to recent algebraic characterizations of the P=?NP problem.  In particular,
we will see how primes in arithmetic progression, complex roots of
sparse polynomials in one variable, and circuit complexity are all brought
together via complexity theory.
<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp;   We assume no background in complexity theory, algebraic geometry, 
or number theory.

   <b>Abstract:</b> &nbsp; 
An important part of kinematics is the research of mechanisms, where a
mechanism is a structure which consists of rigid bodies joined by
different joints. Examples are planar bar-linkages or all types of
robots. Investigation of such mechanisms leads to questions like the
following: Which points can be reached by a robot? How many possible
ways are there to reach a special point? Are there singular positions of
the mechanism where it becomes shaky? It is necessary to find a
mathematical description of the mechanism.
It is common practice to attach two orthonormal frames to the mechanism,
one to the fixed part, the other one to the mobile part. After that all
transformations which move the first frame to the second frame are
studied. A very convenient way to do this the usage of kinematic
mapping. This mapping maps each proper transformation in space onto a
point lying on Study's Quadric in the 7-dim. projective space.
So all possible positions of the mechanism correspond to a set of points
on Study's Quadric, where this set can be described by a system of
polynomial equations. Now to answer the questions one can study the
ideal generated by those equations.
In this talk it shall be shown how to translate a given mechanism into
the describing system of polynomial equations.

 I will introduce some basic notions in geometric modeling,
which is the science of modeling curves and surfaces by small patches
(e.g. B&eacute;zier patches). I will discuss some of the properties of these
patches and then focus on the property known as linear precision. I will
show how algebraic geometry can be used to answer some questions about
linear precision for a general class of multi-sided patches known as
toric patches. Finally, I will also discuss some interactions between
these topics and algebraic statistics.

I will explain how commutative-algebraic knowledge of binomial ideals
(namely, their primary decomposition) can be used in the study of
hypergeometric functions. The lecture will include a brief overview of a
combinatorial description of the primary components of binomial ideals,
and requires no background in special functions or differential equations.

   <b>Abstract:</b> &nbsp; 
     Gale duality for polynomial systems is an elementary reformulation of a system of 
     polynomial equations as a system of equations involving 
     rational master functions in the complement of a hyperplane arrangement.
     Some properties of the original system are easier to understand in the
     Gale dual system.<BR>

     &nbsp; &nbsp; 
     In the first part of this talk, I will describe this Gale duality, look at some
     examples of this construction, and give some elementary consequences.
     In the second half, I will explain how to bound the number of real solutions to 
     the Gale dual system, and thereby obtain the current best bounds for the number of 
     real solutions to a system of polynomial equations.
     I will also explain how this gives rise to a new numerical method for finding all
     real solutions to a system of polynomial equations.

   <b>Abstract:</b>  &nbsp; 
Implicitization is the problem of computing the defining ideal of the
image of a polynomial map, and elimination is the problem of
computing the defining ideal of the projection of an algebraic
variety.  In this talk, we will apply tropical methods to these
problems.  For generic cases, we can use polyhedral computations to
construct the tropical varieties of the unknown ideals without
computing the ideal.  We will also see a demonstration of tropical
softwares Gfan and TrIm.

   <b>Abstract:</b>  &nbsp; 
The problem of synthesizing a set of fixed structure controllers has
been open for the past four decades. The problem may be simply stated as
follows: Given a characteristic polynomial, <i>P</I>(<i>s</i>,<i>K</i>), whose coefficients
are affine in the controller parameter vector, <i>K</i>, what values of <i>K</i>
render <i>P</I>(<i>s</i>,<i>K</i>) Hurwitz? Through the Routh-Hurwitz theorem, this problem
is equivalent to the determination of a set of controller parameters
that satisfy a system of polynomial inequalities. In this talk, I will
provide a way to approximate the set arbitrarily, at the expense of
additional computation, through the use of Descartes' Rule of signs and
its generalization, Hermite-Biehler Theorem and linear programming
technique. I will also provide examples of the presented method to some
problems encountered in engineering applications.

   <b>Abstract:</b>  &nbsp; 
   We consider the issue of exploiting symmetries in the hierarchy
of semidefinite programming relaxations recently introduced in polynomial
optimization. After providing the necessary background we focus on
problems where either the symmetric or the cyclic group is acting on the
variables and extend the representation-theoretical methods of Gatermann
and Parrilo to constrained polynomial optimization problems. Moreover, we
also propose methods to efficiently compute lower and upper bounds for the
subclass of problems where the objective function and the constraints are
described in terms of power sums.

   <b>Abstract:</b>  &nbsp; 
 A useful strategy in combinatorial commutative algebra is to
"reduce to the monomial case".  Generally speaking, we have an
operation which takes as input an arbitrary ideal  I and outputs some
other ideal <I>f</i>(<i>I</i>).  In the situations of interest, it might be difficult
to compute <I>f</i>(<i>I</i>) directly, so we can instead try to do the same
operation for an initial monomial ideal.  We then cross our fingers and
hope that  in(<I>f</i>(<i>I</i>)) = <I>f</i>(in(<i>I</i>)) and that this operation can be used to
compute <I>f</i>(<i>I</i>).  In particular, in many situations, <I>f</i>(in(<i>I</i>)) proves a
convenient guess for in(<I>f</i>(<i>I</i>)) from which many properties of 
 <I>f</i>(<i>I</i>) can be
deduced, including its Grobner basis.
<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; 
In this talk, I will try to describe two or three situations where this
proves to be a useful strategy, in particular, for studying secant
varieties, symbolic powers, and toric fiber products.  In these cases
computing <I>f</i>(in(<i>I</i>)) leads to combinatorics that is interesting in its
own right.  Time permitting, I will show how these results connect back
to the algebraic statistical models described in my lectures.
