Suppose we are given linear subspaces $K\sb 1,\cdots, K\sb n$ of $\bold
C\sp {m+p}$ with $\dim K\sb i=m+1-k\sb i$ and $k\sb 1+\cdots +k\sb n=mp$. The
problem
is to find all p-dimensional linear subspaces of $\bold C\sp {m+p}$
which meet each $K\sb i$ nontrivially. When the given linear subspaces
are in general position, there is a finite number $d=d(m,p,k\sb 1,\cdots, k\sb n)$ 
of such $p$-planes.
<P>
The objective of this paper is to present semi-numerical algorithms
for computing all d solution planes from the input data $K\sb 1,\cdots,
K\sb n$. Two homotopy algorithms which treat the important special case
$k\sb 1=\cdots=k\sb n=1$ are given. The first algorithm is derived from a
Grobner basis for the Plucker ideal of a
Grassmannian and the second from a SAGBI basis for its projective
coordinate ring.  (For definitions see B. Sturmfels [Grobner bases
and convex polytopes, Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, RI, 1996; MR 97b:13034].)
Both the Grobner homotopy and SAGBI homotopy are
techniques for finding linear sections of Grassmannians in their
Plucker embedding.
<P>
In Section 3, the authors describe a numerical method for solving the
general case of our problem. This is the method for solving the
polynomial equations defined by special Schubert conditions. Here a
sequence of delicate intrinsic deformations, called Pieri homotopies,
which were introduced in a paper by F. Sottile [Canad. J. Math. 49
(1997), no. 6, 1281--1298; MR 2000b:14070], is
applied.
<P>
Some computational results and applications of these algorithms to control
theory and real enumerative geometry are discussed.
