\noindent {\color{Maroon}\bf Definition:} An integer $a$ is \demph{even} if there is an integer $k$ such that $n=2k$.
An integer $a$ is \demph{odd} if there is an integer $k$ such that $n=2k{+}1$.


\noindent {\color{Maroon}\bf Definition:} Let $a$ and $b$ be integers.
We say that $a$ \demph{divides} $b$ and write $a|b$ if there is an integer $c$ such that $ac=b$.



\noindent {\color{Maroon}\bf Definition:}  Let $a$, $b$, and $m$ be integers.
We say that $a$ and $b$ are \demph{congruent modulo $m$} if $m$ divides their difference, $a-b$.
That is, when $m|(a-b)$.
We write \defcolor{$a\equiv b\mod m$} when this occurs.


\noindent {\color{Maroon}\bf Definition:}
Let $A$ and $B$ be sets.
We say that \demph{$A=B$} ($A$ equals $B$) of they have the same elements/members.
That is, if $\forall x (x\in A \Leftrightarrow x\in B)$.


\noindent {\color{Maroon}\bf Definition:}
We say that \demph{$A\subseteq B$} if for every $x$, if $x\in A$, then $x\in B$.\medskip

\begin{enumerate}  %  the \begin{..}  \end{..} stars and ends an environment.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Write the converse and contrapositive of the following conditional statements:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item If it rains, then the grass is wet.
    \item $\alpha^2=25$ if $\alpha=5$.
    \item The integer $a$ is odd only if $3a$ is odd.
    \item ``Inattentive when bored''.
    \item ``Quiet is necessary for sleep''.
    \item ``Pepperoni is necessary for Pizza''.
  \end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  
\item  Consider the following   ``proof'' that if $m$ and $n$ are even, then $m{+}n$ is even:

  We know that $n=2t$ and $m=2t$, so $m{+}n=2t+2t= 4t$.  Therefore $m{+}n$ is even.


  \begin{enumerate}
   \item   Criticize (discuss its shortcomings).
  
    \item  Write a  correct proof of this statement in paragraph form.
  \end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item
  Which of the following statement are true and which are false?  Justify your conclusions.  (E.g.\ give a proof or a counterexample.)
  
 \begin{enumerate}
   \item
     If $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers, then $ab + ac$ is an even integer.
   \item
     If  $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers with both  $b$ and $c$ odd integers, then $ab + ac$ is an even integer.
 \end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

 \newpage

 For these next two,  sketch it first (perhaps in a table form), and then write it in paragraph form.
 The LaTeX file contains a template for the talbe at the end.
  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Let $x\in \ZZ$.  Prove that if $2^{2x}$ is an odd integer, then $2^{-2x}$ is an odd integer.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Recall that for integers $m,n$ we sat that $m$ divides $n$, written $m|n$, if there is an integer $p$ such that $n=mp$.
   Prove the following statement:

     For integers $a$, $b$, and $c$, if $a|b$ and $a|c$, then $a|(b+c)$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \item Write a proof in paragraph form of the statement: For all integers $a$ and $b$, if $a|b$ and $b|a$, then either
   $a=b$ or $a=-b$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \item Write a proof in paragraph form of the statement: For all integers $a,b,m$ if $a\equiv b\mod m$, then
   $a^2\equiv b^2\mod m$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \item Write a proof in paragraph form of the statement: For all integers $a,b,m,n$ if $a\equiv b\mod m$ and $n|m$, then
   $a\equiv b\mod n$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \item Write a proof in paragraph form of the statement: Two sets $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if $A\subseteq B$ and
     $B\subseteq A$.

 %  Tabular is an environment in LaTeX that formats tables.
  %  The {|c|c||c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} specifies that there are 9 columns, each with entries centered (c) and | delimiters between them,
  %    *and* one at the beginning and ay the end, and an extra one after the first two columns  
  %  \hline is 'horizontal line'
  %  The cells are typeset in ordinary text, and are delimited (separated) by the ampersands, &
   %
  \begin{tabular}{l|l}\hline   
    %
    %   Edit these for your own table.  Also make sure to adjust the number of columns.
