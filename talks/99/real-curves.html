In the last century, Schubert defined enumerative geometry to be concerned
with `counting geometric figures of some kind having specified position
with respect to some general fixed figures'.   More recently, Fulton asked
how many solutions to such a problem can be real; in particular can the
fixed figures be chosen so that all solutions are real.  
<p>
   
   For the problem of the 3264 conics tangent to 5 general plane conics,
Ronga, Tognoli, and Vust found the (surprising) answer that all may be real.
In fact, for every known example, all solutions may be real.  The purpose of
this talk is to present two new families of enumerative problems with this
property.   One arise from the classical Schubert calculus of enumerative
geometry on the Grassmannian, and the second from the quantum Schubert
calculus enumerating rational curves on the Grassmannian. 
The picture above shows the first non-trivial case of both.
