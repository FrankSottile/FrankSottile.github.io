The Shape of Space

Frank Sottile

In this talk, I will try to give you an idea of how
mathematicians manage to say anything meaningful about
higher-dimensional spaces, and relate this to the recent
proof of the Poincare conjecture that won the Millenium
Prize of the Clay Institute.  Besides bringing your
enquiring minds, at least 50% of the audience needs
to bring a belt for those articles will play a key role
in our discussion.
