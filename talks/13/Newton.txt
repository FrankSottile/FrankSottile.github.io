Newton polytopes via witness sets

   The fundamental combinatorial invariant of a polynomial f is
its Newton polytope---the convex hull of the exponent vectors 
of its monomials.   Oftentimes, f is given implicitly and we do 
not have access to its expansion in terms of monomials.  We 
present numerical algorithms to determine the Newton polytope 
of such a polynomial, in two cases.   The first algorithm assumes 
that we may only compute values of f, and the second that we have 
a representation of the hypersurface H defined by f as a witness set.

  This talk will give background from numerical algebraic 
geometry and present these algorithms.  We illustrate the 
second algorithm, computing the face of the Lueroth invariant 
corresponding to even quartics.  This is joint work with Jon
Hauenstein.
