   Mathematical theorems often originate as conjectures, which were formulated to explain
    some observed phenomena or to develop a general theory.
   Belief in these conjectures---often necessary for their proof---typically
   rests upon the theoretical justifications.<br><br>
   
   &nbsp; &nbsp; 
   I'll try to give you some flavor of a path to mathematical truth that is
   much less traveled, as it is through conjectures supported primarily by
   overwhelming empirical evidence.
   This path represents what I believe is an important future trend.
   This is exemplified by a study and formulation of conjectures concerning a 
   simple method that forces 
   all solutions to a certain class of geometric problems to be real.
