     We illuminate the relation between the Bruhat order and structure
constants for the polynomial ring in terms of its basis of Schubert
polynomials.  We use combinatorial, algebraic, and geometric methods,
notably a study of intersections of Schubert varieties and maps between flag
manifolds.  We establish a number of new identities among these structure
constants.  This leads to formulas for some constants and new results on the
enumeration of chains in the Bruhat order.  A new graded partial order (the
Grassmann-Bruhat order) on
the symmetric group which contains Young's lattice arises from these
investigations.  We also derive formulas for certain specializations of
Schubert polynomials.
