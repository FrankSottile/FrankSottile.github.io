New Hopf Structures on Planar Binary Trees

   Two of  the most interesting  combinatorial Hopf algebras  are the
Hopf algebras of permutations and  of planar binary trees.  These fit
into  an  interesting commutative  diagram  involving the  symmetric,
noncommutative  symmetric, and  quasisymmetric functions.   They also
each have two different bases related by Moebius inversion on a poset
which reveal a rich interaction between their algebraic structure and
the combinatorics of permutations and of trees.  These posets are the
edge graphs of the permutahedra and the associahedra, and the algebra
structure is also linked to the structure of these polytopes.

   Both the permutahedra and associahedra arise naturally in homotopy
theory, and the point of departure for this talk is another family of
polytopes, the  multiplihedra, which  also arose in  homotopy theory.
Natural cellular maps from permutahedra to associahedra (which induce
maps of Hopf algebras) factor through the multiplihedra.  Restricting
this map  to their vertices  factorizes the map from  permutations to
trees.  The  intermediate objects  are certain bi-leveled  trees.  We
show  how to  put algebraic  structures on  bi-leveled trees  so that
their  linear  span M  becomes  a module  over  the  Hopf algebra  of
permutations  and a  Hopf module  algebra  over the  Hopf algebra  of
trees.   A  second basis  of  M, related  to  the  first via  Moebius
inversion on  the multiplihedra helps to  elucidate these structures.
Bi-leveled trees also admit a second structure as a Hopf algebra, and
we  identify  other combinatorial  objects  between permutations  and
trees which  similarly are related  to polytopes and admit  some Hopf
structures.  This is joint work with Aaron Lauve and Stefan Forcey.
