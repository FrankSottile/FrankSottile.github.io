 &nbsp; &nbsp; 
 About 12 years ago, Boris Shapiro and Michael Shapiro made a remarkable conjecture about
 real solutions to geometric problems coming from the classical Schubert calculus
 on a Grassmannian. 
 The conjecture was proven recently by Mukhin, Tarasov, and Varchenko, using a deep
 connection between integral systems and Schubert calculus.
 This was popularized through extensive computational evidence,
 and these computational experiments led to a subtle extension of it to flag manifolds.
 A special case of this generalization was proven by Eremenko and others, and their
 work suggests a generalization of the original Shapiro conjecture.
 A feature of this story is an interesting dialog between theory and experiment.

 In my talk, I will introduce the Shapiro conjecture and some of its extensions.
 In particular, I will describe the large-scale experiments we have run to 
 formulate these extensions and the convincing evidence found.
 This is joint work with Luis Garcia, and our research team at Texas A&amp;M University.
