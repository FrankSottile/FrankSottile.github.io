Irrational toric varieties and the secondary polytope

The secondary fan of a point configuration A in R^n encodes
all regular subdivisions of A.  These subdivisions also record 
all limiting objects obtained by weight degenerations of the
irrational toric variety X_A parameterized by A.

The secondary fan is the normal fan of the secondary polytope.
We explain a functorial construction of R^n-equivariant cell 
complexes from fans that, when applied to the secondary fan,
realizes the secondary polytope as the moduli space of translations
and degenerations of X_A.  This extends the work of Kapranov,
Sturmfels and Zelevinsky (who established this for complex toric
varieties when A is integral) to all real configurations A.
