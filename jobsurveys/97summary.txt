                   Summary of 1997 YMN Job Survey

In May, we asked our readers to share with us their experiences on the
job market this year.  We received 64  responses.  Here, I
have tried to compile some of the data gleaned from those responses.
These data suggest a possible softening of the academic job market.


The following chart compares applicant's previous position (horizontal)
versus situation next year (vertical).  These categories are what the
applicants indicated about their positions.  

tt := tenure track, temp := temporary, pd := postdoctoral positions,
grad := graduate student, part := part time, ps := private sector & gov,
nj := no job at the time of survey.

total   5    8    18   31      2       64     

Respondents were invited to indicate the duration of temporary or
postdoctoral positions:

	 temp   pd
1-year    6      4
2-year    3      5
3-yer            6


Here is a factoid:  People receiving academic job offers received an
average of  1.72 each.   In 1995, this was 1.5, and in 1996, 1.75.


The next chart is a histogram with frequency plotted horizontally.

Date of initial job offer by type of employment.

	    Comments

There are significant differences between this survey and
the surveys from the previous two years:

First, only 4 out of 64, 6.25% are unemployed, less that 1/4 of 
what we found last year.  That is quite encouraging.  

Also, people sent out significantly fewer applications; there were
medians of about 70 each of the past two years, and this year the
median is closer to 40.   Perhaps this represents a greater optimism
among the applicants.

The width of the time scale (in particular, the earlier offers) may
be due to competitive pressures between institutions to snap up
candidates.  Several respondents were surprised by how quickly some
institutions moved.

In the anecdotes (compiled separately) there is quite a bit of optimism,
something that has been missing in recent years.

Since this survey was by no means scientific, we will have to wait until
the Autumn when the AMS-SIAM-IMA survey comes out to find out the real
picture (for more PhD's)
