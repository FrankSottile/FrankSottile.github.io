Real Enumerative Geometry and Solving Systems of Equations

A short course of four lectures

Finding the isolated real solutions to a system of real polynomial equations
is a challenging, yet important problem with real world
applications. Effective techniques exist for this problem, and their
improvement and implementation are currently areas of active research.  Also
of interest are upper bounds on the number of real solutions.  In many
geometric situations, the sharp bound is the number of complex solutions.
This series of four lectures will discuss this problem from a geometric
perspective, and include a number of open questions.
