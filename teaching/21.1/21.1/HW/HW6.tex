\noindent
Write your answers neatly, in complete sentences, and prove all assertions.
Start each problem on a new page (this makes it easier in Gradescope).
Revise your work before handing it in, and submit a .pdf  created from a LaTeX source to Gradescope.
Correct and crisp proofs are greatly appreciated; oftentimes your work can be shortened and made clearer.

 \item  For any homomorphism $f\colon A\to B$ of left $R$-modules, prove that the diagram
   \[
    \begin{picture}(80,62)(-5,0)
        \put(  0,50){$A$} \put( 17,54){\vector(1,0){28}}\put(24,58){\small$\theta_A$}  
        \put( 50,50){$A^{**}$} 
 
        \put(  7,45){\vector(0,-1){32}}  \put( -4,30){\small$f$}
        \put( 57,45){\vector(0,-1){32}}  \put( 60,30){\small$f^{**}$}

        \put(  0,0){$B$} \put( 17,4){\vector(1,0){28}} \put(24, 8){\small$\theta_B$}   
        \put( 50,0){$B^{**}$} 
        \end{picture}
 \]
 is commutative.
 Here $\defcolor{\theta_A}\colon A \to A^{**}$ is the natural map from the $A$-module to its second dual, and\newline
 $\defcolor{f^{**}}\colon A^{**}\to B^{**}$ is the double pullback map between second duals.

 Conclude that $\theta$ is a natural transformation from the identity functor on the category of left $R$-modules to the functor $^{**}$ of
 taking second duals.

\item  Let $R$ be a ring and $M$ a finitely-generated left $R$-module.
  Recall that $\Hom_R(M,R)$ is a right $R$-module.\newline
  Show that if $M$ is projective, then $\Hom_R(M,R)$ is projective.

  Show that  if $M$ is projective, then $M$ is a reflexive $R$-module.

 \item
   Let $F$ be a free left $R$-module of infinite rank.
   Show that $F$ is not reflexive.
