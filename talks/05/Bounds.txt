Bounds for real solutions to structured polynomial systems

   Understanding the real solutions to systems of polynomial
equations  is a difficult  question with  many applications.
In  particular, a  non-trivial lower  bound is  an existence
proof  for  solutions  and  non-trivial  upper  bounds  give
complexity bounds.

   The  best-known upper bound  is due  to Khovanski  and is
unrealistically large.  A  recent breakthrough of Li, Rojas,
and Wang  suggests the possibility of  more reasonable upper
bounds.

   Lower bounds are a  very recent phenomenon, having arisen
in quantum cohomology and  (separately) with the Wronski map
in  Schubert calculus.  The  results, though,  are striking:
"Most" rational  curves of degree d  interpolating 3d-1 real
points in  the plane are real, every  rational function with
only real critical points is real.

  In  this talk, I  will describe  this background  and then
discuss  recent work giving  upper and  lower bounds  on the
numbers of real solutions to some sparse polynomial systems.
This  is jout work  with Soprunova  (lower bounds)  and with
Bihan, Bertrand, and Rojas (upper bounds).
