<p><b>Abstract:</b> 
We present families of sparse polynomial systems having a lower bound on their
number of real solutions. Each family is unmixed with Newton polytope the order
polytope of a finite poset P that is ranked (mod 2) and whose maximal chains
have equal length (mod 2). The lower bound is the sign-imbalance of the
poset---this is the difference between the number of even and of odd linear
extensions of the poset P. The sign-imbalance is interpreted as the topological
degree of a certain folding map of an associated simplicial complex.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; 
Our tools are combinatorics of toric varieties, toric degenerations, and some
topology. Using sagbi degenerations, we recover results of Eremenko and Gabrielov
on the degree of the Wronski map.
