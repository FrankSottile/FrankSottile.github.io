<H2>Enumerative Real Algebraic Geometry</H2>

Frank Sottile



<P>
Enumerative real algebraic geometry asks questions about the real
solutions to problems from enumerative geometry, when the conditions
in the problem are real. This is the geometric version of the
important problem of determining the real solutions to a system of
polynomial equations. While this subject is fairly new (the motivating
question was asked in 1984, and the first problems were studied from
this perspective in the early 1990's) some basic themes are emerging.
<P>
One theme is that it seems to be always possible to arrange that the
solution figures to an `honest' intersection problem are all
real. When this occurs, we call the enumerative problems <I>fully
real</I>. Another theme is that there often exist lower bounds on the
number of real solutions better than trivial bounds. What is not yet
clear is whether these lower bounds are sharp, or how widespread is
the phenomenon of full reality.
<P>
  This comprehensive article describe the current state of knowledge,
indicating these themes, and suggests lines of future research. In particular,
it compares the state of knowledge in Enumerative Real Algebraic Geometry with
what is known about real solutions to systems of sparse polynomials.
