 Consider the coradical  filtration of the Hopf algebras  of planar binary trees
of Loday  and Ronco and  of permutations of  Malvenuto and Reutenauer.   We show
that  the associated graded  Hopf algebras  are dual  to the  cocommutative Hopf
algebras  introduced in  the  late 1980's  by  Grossman and  Larson. These  Hopf
algebras   are  constructed   from   ordered  trees   and  heap-ordered   trees,
respectively. We also show that whenever  one starts from a Hopf algebra that is
a cofree graded coalgebra, the associated  graded Hopf algebra is a shuffle Hopf
algebra. This implies  that the Hopf algebras of  ordered trees and heap-ordered
trees are tensor Hopf algebras.
