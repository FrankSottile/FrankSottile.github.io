The special Schubert calculus is real

In the last century, Schubert defined enumerative geometry to be concerned
with `counting geometric figures of some kind having specified position
with respect to some general fixed figures'.   More recently, Fulton asked
how many solutions to such a problem can be real; in particular can the
fixed figures be chosen so that all solutions are real.  

   
   For the problem of the 3264 conics tangent to 5 general plane conics,
Ronga, Tognoli, and Vust found the (surprising) answer that all may be real.
In fact, for every case known, all solutions may be real.  The purpose of
this talk is to present two new families of enumerative problems with this
property.  The first are those arising from special Schubert conditions on
p-planes in C^{m+p}, and the second concerns parameterized rational curves
in a Grassmannian satisfying certain simple (codimension 1) conditions.
