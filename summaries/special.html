From the introduction: {\it W. Fulton} asked how many solutions to a problem
of enumerative geometry can be real, when that problem is one of counting
geometric figures of some kind having specified position with respect to
some general fixed figures [see: ``Introduction to intersection theory in
algebraic geometry'', Lect. CBMS regional Conf. 1983 (1984; 3rd edition
1996; Zbl 913.14001)]. For the problem of plane conics tangent to five
general conics, the (surprising) answer is that all 3264 may be real [{\it
F. Ronga}, {\it A. Tognoli} and {\it T. Vust}, Rev. Mat. Univ. Complutense
Madr. 10, No. 2, 392-421 (1997; see the preceding review)]. Recently, {\it
P. Dietmaier} [in: Advances robot kinematics: Analysis and control. 6th
Symp., Salzburg 1998, 7-16 (1998)] has shown that all 40 positions of the
Stewart platform in robotics may be real. Similarly, given any problem of
enumerating lines in projective space incident on some general fixed linear
subspaces, there are real fixed subspaces such that each of the (finitely
many) incident lines are real.\par 

For any problem of enumerating $p$-planes having excess intersection with a
collection of fixed planes, the paper under review shows that there is a
choice of fixed planes osculating a rational normal curve at real points so
that each of the resulting $p$-planes is real. This has implications for the
problem of placing real poles in linear systems theory [{\it C. I. Bryrnes}

Control. Inf. Sci. 135, 31-78 (1989; Zbl 701.93047)].
