Let $G$ be the Grassmannian of complex $k$-dimensional subspaces of
${\bold C}\sp n$. In this note the author shows that for any enumerative
problem on $G$ given by an intersection of special Schubert cycles,
there exist real cycles for which all of the (a priori complex)
solutions are real.  The fixed planes which define the special
Schubert conditions are chosen osculating a rational normal curve at
real points.

The short proof uses two results of
D. Eisenbud and J. D. Harris [Invent. Math. 74 (1983), no. 3,
371--418; MR 85h:14019]. The author
notes that his theorem provides evidence for a more general conjecture
of B. Shapiro and M.  Shapiro, which involves arbitrary Schubert
conditions. He also gives an application to the problem of placing
real poles in linear systems theory.<P><P>
