Examples in Lexture 3:


Xe4Ye4 = 12 on F(2,3;5)   50 K in 9.05 days on Schur
   Doing extra 50,000 examples on Schur and on Schubert

Xe5Ye3 = 10 on  F(2,3;5)  25K in 2.47 GHz-days on Pieri 
    Has a discernable lower bound
    Do 75K extra on Pieri ? 


Here is a nice `random' example with a discrnable lower bound.

   2.5 K in 1.41 GHz-days on Chevalley 

----> do at least 7.5K more on rcf1537-9


This one has an upper bound that is less than the total number of real solutions,
and a necklace with exactly 3 of the seven solutions real.  On rcf1522-2,
it did 10,000 in 59 minutes.  compute 240K on another machine

---> More on rcf1422-2, but kill the long job first

Gaps:

               250K  2.96 GHz-days on Clavius
               Has Upper and Lower bounds for 2 different necklaces

   Do another 250K on Noether
