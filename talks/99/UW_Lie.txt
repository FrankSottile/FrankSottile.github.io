Pieri-type formulas in the Schubert Calculus
22 September 1999

Frank Sottile

  An outstanding problem in algebraic combinatorics is to find
the analog of the Littlewood-Richardson rule for Schubert polynomials.
In this talk, which represents joint work with Nantel Bergeron, 
I will discuss some of what is known about this problem.  The particular
focus will be on combinatorial Pieri-type formulas, which serve to illustrate
some features one might expect in an eventual Littlewood-Richardson formula.
