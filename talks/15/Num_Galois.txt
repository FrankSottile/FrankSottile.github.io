Galois Groups via Numerical Algebraic Geometry

Galois groups, which are a mainstay of number theory and arithmetic 
geometry, may be studied using methods from numerical algebraic 
geometry, when the base field is a transcendental extension of the
complex numbers.  This is because the well-known observation (which 
goes back to Hermite) that in this case Galois=monodromy, and computing
monodromy is a basic operation in numerical algebraic geometry.

While simply computing monodromy enables the exploration of a
Galois group, it can only determine the group when it is the
full symmetric group, for there is no stopping criterion.  In work
with Hauenstein and Rodriguez we offer two methods to determine 
a Galois group.  For the first, we compute the branch locus, which
leads to permutations that generate the Galois group.  The second
uses numerical irreducible decomposition of fiber products to 
determine the action of the Galois group, from which it may be 
determined.
