Title: A Gromov-Witten invariant in the real world.

Author: Frank Sottile

Abstract: In the last (20th) century, two different groups of
scientists were led to exactly the same question in pure
mathematics, a problem of counting certain rational curves on a
Grassmannian, that is, determining a particular Gromov-Witten
invariant of the Grassmannian. The work of one group, theoretical
physicists, spawned important mathematical activity including
quantum cohomology. This story of mathematics inspired by physics
is well-known, even though the physical motivation remains obscure
to many mathematicians.

The other group of scientists were engineers working in systems
theory, specifically on the problem of dynamic feedback control of
linear systems.  While their story is less-known, their
motivations for studying curves on Grassmannians are
straightforward and their work leads to a very concrete
understanding of this problem. 

In this talk, I will make the second story better-known,
explaining how engineers were led to study spaces of curves on
Grassmannians and some further mathematics inspired by their work,
particularly, a recursive construction of solutions to this
problem which shows that all solutions may be real.
