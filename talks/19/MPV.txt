A numerical toolkit for multiprojective varieties

A multiprojective variety is a subvariety of a product 
of projective spaces. They may be studied as projective 
varieties under the Segre embedding or locally as affine 
varieties in an affine patch. Both approaches have 
disadvantages, increasing complexity or ignoring structure. 
I will discuss methods from numerical algebraic geometry 
to study multiprojective varieties that take advantage 
of their structure and do not increase the complexity 
of the numerical representation. This is joint work with 
Hauenstein, Leykin, and Rodriguez.
