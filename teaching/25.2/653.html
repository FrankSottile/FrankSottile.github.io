<b><font size=+1 color=brown>Course Description</font></b><br>
<dl>
 <dd>
    This is a first semester graduate course in abstract algebra, and
    is intended to be an introduction to the fundamental objects of groups, rings, modules,
    fields, and vector spaces.
    I intend to cover all of Chapters I and II, and most of IV from Lang's
    classical algebra text (at right).  
    We should cover the following topics, time permitting.
   <ul>
    <li>monoids</li>
    <li>basic group theory</li>
    <li>cyclic groups</li>
    <li>finitely generated abelian groups</li>
    <li>Sylow theorems</li>
    <li>categories and functors<?li>
    <li>free groups and inverse limits</li>
    <li>basic ring theory</li>
    <li>commutative rings</li>
    <li>polynomial and group rings</li>
    <li>localization</li>
    <li>principal ideal domains and unique factorization domains</li>
    <li>polynomials in one variable</li>
    <li>factorization of polynomials</li>
    <li>Hilbert's theorem</li>
    <li>partial fractions</li>
    <li>symmetric polynomials</li>
   </ul>

   <font size=+1 color=brown>Prerequisites:</font>  Undergraduate abstract algebra (Math
   415/6) or its equivalents, as determined by the instructor.

<b><font size=+1 color=brown>Course Particulars:</font></b>
<dl>

 <dd><font size=+1 color=maroon>Graduate Work:</font>
  <dl>
   <dd>
      This is the first of a two-term sequence on Graduate Algebra, which is a
      foundational course covering material that every mathematician should know. 
      It forms the air one breathes in many research fields, from algebra
      to number theory, geometry, algebraic geometry, and algebraic combinatorics, and is assumed in
      many advanced classes in these topics.
      Basic algebra is fundamental to any educated mathematician.
      The pace will be fast and advanced for many, for there is a lot to cover.
      Also, as a graduate class, significantly more is expected of you than in your
      previous courses.
   </dd>
  </dl>
 </dd>
 <!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
 <dd><font size=+1 color=maroon>Reading:</font>
  <dl>
   <dd> You should read the sections of the book <font color=magenta>before</font> they are covered in class, work over
        your notes after lecture (I will not review material covered in previous lectures!),
        and reread the sections after they are covered.
        Rewriting your notes is an excellent path towards full understanding (I did
        this in all of my graduate courses.)
        Some material that you are responsible for will not be covered in class, but may
        be found in the book and in the exercises&mdash;read those too.
     </dd>

  </dl> 
 </dd>
 <!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
 <dd><font size=+1 color=maroon>Homework:</font>
  <dl>
    <dd>There will be weekly written homework assignments to be handed in (on  <font color=magenta>Thursdays</font>, at the start of class)
        and graded.
      Problems may  be assigned in nearly every class; a summary may be found <a href="653_HW.html"><font color=red>here</font></a>.
        These will be marked by our grader, Daniel Dale, an advanced senior graduate student, and returned on
        <font color=magenta>Tuesdays</font>.   There may be homework you are to hand into Frank.<br>
        As this is a qualifying class, there will be plenty of homework, and you should use it as a way to master the
        material, which as noted is fundamental to any educated mathematician.
    </dd>
   <dd>Note that late homework is not accepted.
   </dd>
    <dd><font color=red></font><b>Zeroth homework:</b> Read this page and the course
  <a href="https://tamu.simplesyllabus.com/api2/doc-pdf/s164fxvcl/Fall-2025-College-Station-MATH-653-600-%2812019%29-ALGEBRA-I.pdf?locale=en-US">syllabus</a>, found in Canvas, and send a note to Frank
    (by email, 653 in the subject line) that you have read and understood the syllabus and course homepage and
    pledge to abide by the course rules as detailed in those documents.
    Please also include in that a brief description of who you are, your mathematical background, what you hope to get out of the course,
    and anything else that you want me to know about you.
   </dd>
   <dd> Because I understand the pressures that advanced undergraduates and graduates face, I will drop your lowest homework score.
   </dd>

  </dl> 
 </dd>
 <!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
 <dd><font size=+1 color=maroon>Writing Mathematics:</font>
  <dl>
   <dd>Developing your ability to write mathematics well is a critical skill for your
       future studies, and careful writing is linked to clear thinking.
      Clear, crisp, and correct writeups of problems and proofs are to be expected and should be your goal.
      For example, after working out the solution to a homework problem, which is at best
       a very rough draft, you should then <i>neatly</i> write up the solution properly,
       omitting needless steps and falsehoods (remember, a false claim in a proof
       invalidates the proof and results in a score of zero), and striving for clarity and brevity.
 <!--      To facilitate this development, I will assign and collect some problems
       which I will mark, using a significantly more rigourous scale than perhaps that
       employed by our grader, which will be discussed in class.       -->
    </dd>

  </dl>
 </dd>
 <!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
 <dd><font size=+1 color=maroon>Group Work:</font>
  <dl>
   <dd>You are encouraged to work together to find solutions to the homework.
       However, you must write up the work you turn in yourself.
       Also, you are absolutely forbidden to consult web sites or problem solution sources
       (other than the textbook and class notes).
       Violating this rule has serious consequences, both as it violates the university's
       academic integrity policy (read that in the official syllabus), 
       and because not doing your own work will likely lead to an inability to do the problems 
       on the course exams and very poor marks.
       A handy place to collaborate could be Blocker suite 601; it has three boards and a nearby expert or three.
   </dd>
  </dl>
 </dd>
 <!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
 <dd><font size=+1 color=maroon>Exams:</font>
  <dl>
   <dd>
     The class will have <font color=red>three</font> exams.
     They will be evening exams during the semester, likely 3 hours each.  Sottile will provide dinner.
     They will be during the weeks of September 24, October 29, and December 3.
     There is no final exam for this class.
   </dd>
  </dl>
 </dd>
 <!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------> 
 <dd><font size=+1 color=maroon>Grading:</font> 
  <dl>
   <dd>
     Your course grade will be based in equal parts on homework and the midterm exams, 
     That is, 25% homework, and each exam is worth 25%.<br>

     I will use the following scale for grades:<br>
     <b>A</b>: Above 85%<br>
     <b>B</b>: Between 65% and 85%<br>
     <b>C</b>: Below 65%<br>
     These may be adjusted with lower cut-offs if necessary, as I intend to assign grades that reflect the historical grade distribution.
   </dd>
  </dl>
 </dd>
 <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
 <dd><font size=+1 color=maroon>Device Policy:</font> 
  <dl>
   <dd>
   I have a zero-tolerance policy towards electronic devices in class.
   In particular no phones, and no laptops.
   The exceptions are if you have an accommodation, if we have discussed this before, or if we are using computer algebra software that day.
   It is OK to use a tablet for notes if you write with a stylus, and pen(cil) on paper is always OK.<br>

   Use  of an unauthorized device in class will result in your dismissal from class that day.
