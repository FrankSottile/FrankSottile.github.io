  The theorem of Mukhin, Tarasov, and Varchenko (formerly the Shapiro conjecture for
  Grassmannians) asserts that all ({<i>a priori</i> complex) solutions to certain
  geometric problems in the Schubert calculus are actually real. Their proof is quite
 remarkable, using ideas from integrable systems, Fuchsian differential equations, and
 representation theory.  
 There are now three proofs of this result, and it has
 ramifications in other areas of mathematics, from curves to control theory to combinatorics.
 Despite this work, the original Shapiro conjecture is not yet settled.
 While it is false as stated, it has several interesting and not quite understood
 modifications and generalizations that are likely true, and the strongest and most subtle
 version of the Shapiro conjecture for Grassmannians remains open.
