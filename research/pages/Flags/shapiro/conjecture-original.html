<H2>Shapiro and Shapiro's original conjecture</H2>

Here is an excerpt from a letter in which Boris Shapiro reminded Sottile of
the conjectures he communicated the previous May.

Letter from Boris Shapiro in the Autumn of 1995.
<BR>

<P>
....I want to remind you of my explicit conjecture how to find fully real
arrangements of Schubert cells of a given type <I>at least in the space of
complete flags</I>. (But apparently this holds also for incomplete flags as
well.)   I had it in mind and formulated it to you last Spring.
<P>

Consider a rational normal curve \gamma in real projective space.
Choose any number of osculating complete flags 
<I>f</I><SUB>1</SUB>, ..., <I>f<SUB>k</SUB></I> to \gamma.
Take in the space of complete flags <I>k</I> Schubert cell deompositions
w.r.t. eack of the above flags and pick one cell from each of these
decompositions.
<P>

Conjecture (about 1993).   The intersection of these cells is fully real (if
nonempty), i.e. the sum of its Betti numbers (mod <b>Z</b><SUB>2</SUB>)
coincides with the sum of Betti numbers  (mod <b>Z</b><SUB>2</SUB>) of its
complexification.
(In particular, if the sum of codimensions of Schubert cells equals 
<I>n</I>(<I>n</I>&nbsp;-&nbsp;1)/2, then all points in this 0-dimensional
intersection 
are real.)

<BR><HR><BR>
This is similar to an earlier conjecture of Boris Shapiro concerning the
phenomenon of reality in enumerative geometry.
Here is an <A HREF="Shapiro-letterII.V.html">email</A> in which he formulates
that conjecture.
