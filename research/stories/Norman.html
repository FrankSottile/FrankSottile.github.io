Consider the classical geometric problem:
How many lines meet 4 lines in space?
The picture at right illustrates the solution: there are two such lines.
(The given lines are in <font color=blue>blue</font>, the solution lines
in <font color=green>green</font>, and the saddle surface is an auxiliary
construction that helps solve the problem.)
Understanding generalizations of this problem continues to be important in
mathematics.
Interestingly, solutions to this very problem arise in other subjects, often in
a disguised form:

    engineering, 
<LI> the <font color=green>rational functions</font> having prescribed
  <font color=blue>critical points</font>, &nbsp; and
<LI> <font color=green>indeterminate lines of sight</font> to objects whose
   edges include the <font color=blue>four lines</font>.
   Indeed, it is precisely along the 
   <font color=green>solution lines</font> that the <font color=blue>four
   lines</font> outlining the objects appear to coincide.

   vision.
