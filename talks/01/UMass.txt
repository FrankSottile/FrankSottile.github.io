A Gromov-Witten Invariant in the Real World

   In the last (20th) century, two different groups of scientists
were led to exactly the same question in pure mathematics, a 
problem of counting certain rational curves on a Grassmannian.  
The work of one group, theoretical physicists, spawned important 
mathematical activity, including quantum cohomology.  This story 
of mathematics inspired by physics is well-known, even though the 
physical motivation remains obscure to many mathematicians.

   The other group of scientists were engineers working in systems 
theory, specifically on the problem of dynamic feedback control of 
linear systems.  While their story is less-known, their motivation 
for studying curves on Grassmannians are straightforward and their 
work leads to a very concrete understanding of this problem.

   In this talk, I will make the second story better-known, explaining
how engineers were led to study spaces of curves on Grassmannians 
and some further mathematics inspired by their work.
