Consider the following problem:<BR>

Determine thet number of connected components of the set of
common transversals to 4 line segments.<BR>


<B>Answer:</B>
 The question makes sense for any number <i>n</i> of line segments.
 The bound is 2 except in 3 special degenerate cases.<BR>

<ul>
<li> Assuming that <i>n</i> is at least 4, we show that the maximum number of
     components is <i>n</i>, and this occurs only if the segments all lie along the
     lines in one ruling of a hyperboloid of one sheet.
     (All smaller numbers can occur, as well).
<li> For <i>n</i>>3, there can also be up to <i>n</i> connected components if all 
     segments are coplanar.<BR>
     (This is <i>n</i>-1 if there are <i>n</i>-1 coplanar segments and one
     non-coplanar segment.)
<li> Finally, in addition to these cases, when <i>n</i>=4, there can be three
     connected components if the segments intersect pairwise.
</ul>
 Pictures of all these extreme geometries are presented below.
 In these pictures, the lines segments are <font color=blue>blue</font> and the common
 transversals are in <font color=red>red</font>.
 As there are infinitely many
 common transversals, they form <font color=red>red</font> regions on the
 axillary surfaces that we also draw.
