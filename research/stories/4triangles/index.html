We consider the following simple geometric question:
What is the maximum number of lines that are tangent to 
four triangles?
(That is, we are counting the lines which meet one edge from each triangle.)
For simplicity, we assume that the triangles are in a suitable general position,
in that the algebraic relaxation where we replace edges by supporting lines has
only finitely many solutions.
(In fact 162 distinct <i>complex</i> solutions.)

<P> &nbsp; &nbsp;
We ask for the maximum possible number, because the minimum is zero:
If the four triangles are sufficiently far apart, say at four corners of a very
large room, then there will be no such common transversals.


<P> &nbsp; &nbsp;
Currently the best answer to this question is that the maximum number is between
62 and 162, with an upper bound of 156 if the triangles are disjoint.
The upper bound is almost surely not the best possible, and we also doubt the
optimality of the lower bound.
This lower bound is due to a construction that we describe in this page
(linked to the picture below on the right).
This construction involves perturbing four line segments having 2 common
transversals, and each of the resulting triangles have one extremely small angle
- they are quite thin.
Our best construction involving four fat triangles has 40 common
transversals.
A description of the computer search we used to find this example is linked to
the picture on the left below, as well as animations.
