<b>Abstract:</b><br>
 We analyze the structure  of the Malvenuto-Reutenauer Hopf algebra of
 permutations in  detail. We give explicit formulas  for its antipode,
 prove that it is a cofree coalgebra, determine its primitive elements
 and its coradical filtration and show that it decomposes as a crossed
 product over  the Hopf algebra of quasi-symmetric  functions. We also
 describe the  structure constants of the multiplication  as a certain
 number of  facets of  the permutahedron. Our  results reveal  a close
 relationship between the structure of  this Hopf algebra and the weak
 order on the symmetric groups.
