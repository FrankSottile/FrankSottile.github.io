In 1876, Harnack proved that a real smooth plane curve of genus 
<I>g</I> has at most <I>g</I>+1
ovals, and he constructed curves  with this maximum number of ovals.
Real plane curves with maximally many ovals are called <I>M</I>-curves, and
their study  (part of Hilbert's 16th Problem) has been a major theme of
real algebraic geometry this century.
One reason is that the class of <I>M</I>-curves is sufficiently
restricted to enable a topological classification, yet also sufficiently
rich for this classification to be interesting.


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This talk, which represents joint work with V. Kharlamov, will introduce 
a rational curve analog of <I>M</I>-curves.
A general rational plane curve of degree <I>d</I> has 
3(<I>d</I>-2) inflection points and 
(<I>d</I>-1)(<I>d</I>-2)/2 nodes.
If it is not general, then it may have cusps as well as inflection points.
A rational curve is <I>maximally inflected</I> if all of its 
inflection points and cusps are real.
The existence of maximally inflected curves is a consequence of a recent
result in the real Schubert calculus, and numerical techniques allow the
construction of many examples. 

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Maximally inflected curves satisfy some topological restrictions;
A maximally inflected curve can have at most (<I>d</I>-3)(<I>d</I>-2)/2
of its nodes be real, by the Klein and Pl&uuml;cker formulas.
Using symbolic methods, we have found other, more subtle restrictions on
the topology of maximally inflected curves.


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Here are some maximally inflected quartic curves, which shows that all
possibilities allowed by the  Klein and Pl&uuml;cker formulas occur, for
maximally inflected quartic curves.<BR>
