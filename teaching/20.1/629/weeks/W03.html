<font color=maroon><h3>Week 3: 27 January 2020. </h3></font>
<ul>
  <li><font color=maroon><B>Opening Remarks:</b></font><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The reading is a bit light this week; I am giving you some space to read your book for the <a href="../Book_Review.html">book
  review</a>. <br>

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These deal with the Greek's forays into number theory and their treatment of infinity.
  It is interesting to note that some of this work that they were fascinated with turned out to be duds (perfect numbers, while cute, are not particularly
  important), while polygonal numbers are simply not important or interesting (except for squares). 
  On the other hand, Euclid's algorithm not only finds the gcd of two integers (and is the foundation for elementary number theory), it also finds the gcd of
  two univariate polynomials.
  It is also one of the bases for the very modern theory of <font color=blue><i>Gr&ouml;bner bases</i></font>, which has led to a computational revolution in
  algebra in the past 50 years.
  I really appreciated Stillwel's discussion connecting the Euclidean Algorithm to constructive solutions of Pell's equation for <i>N</i>=2.
  As he notes, we will see more of this when we look at mathematics from the  Indian subcontinent, but it arises again in the theory of elliptic functions that
  we will try to appreciate closer to the end of this course. <br>

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is useful to read and re-read the second page of Section 4.1 in which mentions the Greek method to show that a particular number
  (e.g. limit of a sequence) could not have anything <i>but</i> a particular value &alpha;.
  This is their method of exhaustion.
  This indirect, but completely rigorous, method was used by Archimedes in his famous proof that &pi;=&pi; where &pi; on the left is defined to be the ratio of
  the circumference of a circle to its diameter, and the one on the right, that of the area of a circle to the square of its radius.
  The Greeks knew that these ratios were constants, but it was Archumedes who showed that they are the same constant.
  (He was able to relate at least two other ratios involving surface area and volumes of spheres, showing that they too are equal to &pi;.)

  <font color=red>It is OK to discuss this among yourselves.  We all have something to learn from each other.</font><br>

     I've always been a fan of perfect numbers.
     Give the defining property of a perfect number.
     Prove that if 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>-1 is a prime number,  <i>p</i>, then 2<sup><i>n</i>-1</sup><i>p</i> is a perfect number.
     Write down four perfect numbers.  Bonus: How many perfect numbers are there?  
    </li>
    <li>
     Continued fractions are somewhat of a lost art.
     It is known, for example, that the truncations of a continued fraction for a real number &alpha; are the best rational approximations to &alpha;.
     Do all four exercises in Section 3.4 of Stillwell.
    </li>
    <li>
       Consider Archimedes' quote from <i>The Method</i>: "It is of course easier to supply the proof when we have previously acquired some
       knowledge of the questions by the method, than it is to find it without any previous knowledge."
       What was "the method" he is referring to?
       What does his quote say about the role of experimentation or studying examples in Mathematics?
    </li>
    <li>
      Archimedes' use of exhaustion to determine areas predated the Calculus by over 1800 years.
      Try your hand at this method by doing the exercises in Stillwell's Section 4.4 to prove the
      formula for the logarithm of product <i>of rational numbers</i>.
    Make sure to use exhaustion and not calculus tricks.
    Why did I restrict to your showing the formula for rational numbers?

    <br>
    <font color=3300AA>This is challenging.  Do discuss it on Piazza.  Let me provide you with a strong hint.
    Suppose that you want to prove that a particular region <i>R</i> has particular number <i>A</i> as its area.
    For this, you consider lower- and upper- approximations of the area of <i>R</i>.
    In this case, you use rectangles (Riemann sums) to get the lower and upper approximations.<br>

    Now here is where the logic of the method of exhaustion comes in.
    You show that for any number <i>L</i> less than <i>A</i>, there is a lower approximation whose rectangles' areas add up to a number exceeding
    <i>L</i>, and the same <i>mutatis mutandis</i> for any number <i>G</i> greater than <i>A</i>.
    This shows that the area of <i>R</i> is <i>A</i>, and it is not by an infinitary process.<br>

    I like to think of this method in the following way:
    To show a number (e.g. the area of <i>R</i>) is some area <i>A</i>, is to show that it cannot be less than <i>A</i> and that it cannot be greater
    than <i>A</i>.<br>
    
    Contrast this to the Calculus, where you have Riemann sums that are not necessarily lower or upper approximations to the region <i>R</i>, but we
    have that the values of the Riemann sums converge to some number.
    In (this modern vierw of The Calculus), we do not need to know <i>A</i>, we find <i>A</i> in taking the integral, using Newton's Fundamental
    Theorem of Calculus.<br>

    What makes The Calculus better&mdash;and this is what I teach, particularly in Calculus 3&mdash;is that by approximating some quantity (say flux
    across a membrane, or surfaces area, or aggregrate gravitational attraction, or ....) by Riemann sums which converge <i>to some value</i>, we
    have not only given a way to calculate the quantity we want, but, and this is important, actually defined that quantity.<br>

    Think about this.  What is the length of a curve that is not made up of arcs of circles or line segments?
    Calculus gives the reasonable and rigorous definition that the length is the limit of lengths of approximating polygons (collections of line segments) or
    arcs of circles. 
    The same is true for other quantities in Science.    
</font><br>

<!-- The three parts of these exercises do blend together.  They are intended to break things up into smaller steps, each of which is more straightforward. The
figure shows an outer approximation of the "area" under $$\frac{1}{x}$$ fro $$1$$ to $$a$$ by $$n$$ rectangles that strictly contain the area.  In the same
approximation by $$n$$ rectangles of the area under $$\frac{1}{x}$$ fro $$b$$ to $$ab$$, you should see that the corresponding rectangles have the same size.
This is also true for the inner approximation (actually, one uses left endpoints and the other right endpoints).


In integral calculus, you use such a transformation to show that the two Riemann sums are the same, and then invoke convergence.  This is an argument that is
either taught in undergraduate calculus (at least when I was a student, or when I taught in Toronto), but is also covered in an analysis course.  It is not as
hard as establishing that integrals have the properties that they do.


For exhaustion, each area is the unique number that is smaller than every outer approximation and larger than every inner approximation.  These two sets of
approximations being the same for both areas implies that the two areas are equal.


Now it is all downhill for the last problem, the area under $$\frac{1}{x}$$ from $$1$$ to $$ab$$ is the sum of the areas under $$\frac{1}{x}$$ from $$1$$ to
$$b$$ and from $$b$$ to $$ab$$, and then invoke the previous result.


I suggested that this may need some Piazza discussion; probably starting on it earlier would have led to a richer "back and forth".  This defining a group law
by an operation on integrals will recur in this book, and I will assign those problems, for they are extremely significant historically for mathematics.  For
this problem, do try to understand this reasoning, and especially the proof by exhaustion.  It is a rigorous method, sometimes a bit tedious, but it sufficed
for a long time for proving such formulas.  You can see its main limitation in this problem: Why does this shape have an area?  The Theory of Riemann integrals,
and later Lesbegue integration give proofs that these integrals do exist, and therefore that quantities such as area (or electrical flux or net gravitational
attraction) are well-defined.  On top of that, they give often important formulas and methods of calculation.

Back to the question you were asked.
From the definition of exhaustion, to show two things are equal, say log(<i>a</i>) and
log(<i>ab</i>)-log(<i>b</i>), is to show how any lower approximation to one can be
transformed into a lower approximation for the other, with the same area, and the same for
upper approximations.  (Note that, as a mathematician, I use log for the logarithm with
respect to the natural base, Euler's number <i>e</i>.)
