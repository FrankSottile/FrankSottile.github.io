 Equivariant cohomology of the quot scheme 

    We study the quot scheme which compactifies the space of rational
curves on a Grassmannian.  Our main result is a presentation of 
its equivariant cohomology using an extension of the formalism of 
Goresky-Kottwicz-Macpherson.

 This is joint work in progress with Tom Braden and Linda Chen.
