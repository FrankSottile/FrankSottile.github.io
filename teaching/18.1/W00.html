<font color=maroon><h3>Week 0: &lt; 16 January 2017. </h3></font>
<ul>
 <li>Your first homework will be to send me a short autobiography:  Who you are, what is
  your mathematical and professional background, what do you do, what do you hope to get
  from this course, what library resources do you have available, have you ever taken a
  distance course before, etc.  Also, you may (optionally) include any other information
  that you feel is worth mentioning or telling me. The more
  information the better for me to get to understand you and what I can do to help you be
  successful in your goals (as they pertain to this class).<br>
  This will be due by the first couple of days of class, <font color=red>Wednesday, 17 January 2017</font>.
  Please send this by a private post to me on Piazza.
  If that does not work, then a simple email to my preferred email address should do.
  <br>
  You should also send me your preferred email address.
  <br>
  I likely will ask that you write a shorter version of this for public consumption by
  the class, posting it in Piazza.</li>

  <li>Getting on Piazza is also absolutely necessary.
  This is an on-line platform for course dicsussions.
  I have found it effective for this class, too.</li>
  
  <li>You need to get a copy of our book, by Stillwell.
   <br>
  It is possible to download a <b>free version</b>  of the text through the TAMU library.<br>
  You also need to get a copy of Bell's <font color=00AAFF>Men of Mathematics</font>.
  My two copies are in a box in my attic (and one is falling aart), so I orderd a new one from Amazon.
  </li>

  <li><font color=maroon><b>Reading</b></font>: (for week one)
    <ul>
     <li>The discussion of <a href="http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Indexes/Babylonians.html">Babylonian Mathematics</a> at the
    St. Andrew's History of Mathematics page.</li>    
     <li><font color=red>There will be more,</font> see the information page for <a href="W01.html">Week 1</a></li>   
    </ul>
  </li>
