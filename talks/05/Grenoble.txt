The Horn recursion in the Schubert calculus

   Work of  Klyachko and  of Knutson and  Tao in  the 1990's
established  the  Horn conjecture,  which  is a  recursively
defined set  of inequalities among  eigenvalues of hermitian
matrices A,  B, and  A+B.  This used  representation theory,
Schubert calculus, and combinatorics.  A consequence is that
other problems in mathematics have a similar Horn recursion,
for example when is a Littlewood-Richardson number non-zero?
Its geometric  counterpart is to determine  when a triple of
Schubert  varieties  in   a  Grassmannian  must  meet.   The
partition indices of such  a triple of Schubert varieties is
called a feasible triple.

  The answer is that a triple is feasible if and only if the
three partitions  satisfy Horn inequalities  parametrized by
all feasible  triples for smaller  Grassmannians.  In brief,
the Schubert  calculus on  a Grassmannian is  controlled (to
some  degree)  by  the  Schubert  calculus  on  all  smaller
Grassmannians.

   My  first   talk  will  begin  by   discussing  the  Horn
inequalities for eigenvalues of hermitian matrices A, B, and
A+B, and what  they mean for geometry.  Then  I will discuss
Belkale's  geometric  proof  of  the Horn  recursion.   This
suggests that other related feasibility problems in Schubert
calculus may have a similar recursive description.

   My  second talk  will describe  a generalization  of this
obtained  in   collaboration  with  Kevin   Purbhoo  of  the
University  of  British  Columbia.   We  give  a  completely
different Horn recursion in the Schubert calculus, involving
cominuscule flag varieties.  This  yields a different set of
valid inequalities for feasibility in Grassmannians, as well
as two  different (but equivalent) sets  of inequalities for
feasibility in the  Lagrangian Grassmannian.  In addition to
giving  these  inequalities,   we  will  also  describe  the
geometry behind our proof.
