<P> &nbsp; &nbsp; 
In mathematical terminology the word <I>amoeba</I> is a 
recent addition.<A HREF="#footnote"><SUP>1</SUP></A> 
It was introduced by I.M.Gelfand, M.M.Kapranov and A.V.Zelevinsky in
their book [<A HREF="#GKZ">2</A>] in 1994. A mathematical amoeba falls short in
being similar to its biological prototype. In the simplest case, it is
a region in <IMG SRC="images/img2.png">, which may pretend to be a picture of amoeba: a
body with several holes (vacuoles) and straight narrowing tentacles
(pseudopods) reaching to infinity.

<P> &nbsp; &nbsp;
A planar amoeba is the image of the zero locus of a polynomial in two
variables  under the map
<CENTER>
 <IMG SRC="images/img3.png">
</CENTER>
For example, here are the amoebas of a linear polynomial and of a quartic
polynomial.

The zero locus of a polynomial in two variables  is called a
<I>plane complex algebraic curve.</I> This is a surface in 
the 4-space 
<IMG
 WIDTH="29" HEIGHT="21" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img4.png"> defined by an equation <IMG
 WIDTH="103" HEIGHT="41" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img5.png">, where <IMG

 SRC="images/img6.png"> is a  polynomial 
<IMG
 WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="41" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img7.png"> with complex coefficients <IMG
 WIDTH="31" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img8.png">.
The minimal convex polygon <IMG
 WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img9.png"> which contains all points
<IMG
 WIDTH="97" HEIGHT="43" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img10.png"> corresponding to non-zero coefficients of the equation 
is called the <I>Newton polygon</I> of <IMG
 WIDTH="18" HEIGHT="38" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img6.png">. 
It represents the
geometry of the equation, and, as we will see, its geometry is closely
related to geometry of the corresponding complex curve 
<IMG
 WIDTH="67" HEIGHT="43" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img11.png"> and
its amoeba <IMG
 WIDTH="71" HEIGHT="43" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img12.png">.

<P> &nbsp; &nbsp;
An amoeba reaches infinity by several tentacles. Each tentacle
accommodates a ray, and narrows exponentially fast towards it. Thus
there is only one ray in a tentacle. The ray is orthogonal to a side
of the Newton polygon and directed along an outward normal of
the side. For each
side of <IMG
 WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img9.png"> there is at least one tentacle
associated to it. The maximal number of such tentacles is a sort of
lattice length of the side: the number of pieces to which the side is
divided by integer lattice points (i.e., points with integer coordinates).
We observe this in the two amoebas above, whoe respective Newton polygons we
display below

Besides components lying between tentacles, there can be bounded
components. The number of bounded components is at most the number 
of interior integer lattice points of <IMG

Although a planar amoeba is not bounded, its area is finite.

Complex curves whose amoebas have the extremal area are very special.
In particular, <!-- MATH

appropriate complex numbers makes such a curve <I>real,</I> i.e.
defined by a polynomial equations with real coefficients. The geometry 
of the real part of this curve is also very special. It has the maximal
number of components among curves with given Newton polygon and the
components are positioned with respect to each other in a special simple 
way. 

<P> &nbsp; &nbsp;
These real curves are remarkable from many viewpoints. They were
discovered by A. Harnack in 1876 when he constructed real algebraic plane
projective curves with the maximal number of components for each degree. 
Only one component of a Harnack curve meets the coordinate axes
(including the line of infinity), and the intersections with the axes 
lie on disjoint arcs of this component. Consideration of amoebas
allowed G.Mikhalkin to prove that any real curve with these properties
must be topologically isotopic to a Harnack curve. 

<P> &nbsp; &nbsp;
One of the main analytic tools used in study of amoebas is a remarkable 
<I>Ronkin function</I>  <!-- MATH

<IMG

behaves like the Ronkin function of a monomial: it is
linear, and its gradient is the corresponding integer point of
<IMG
 WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

 ALT="$ \Delta$">. The maximum of these linear functions is a piecewise linear
convex function. The set where it is not differentiable is a union
of segments and rays contained in the amoeba and being its deformation
retract. It is called the <I>spine</I> of <!-- MATH

<P> &nbsp; &nbsp;
Logarithmic coordinates and amoebas disclose a piecewise linear stream
in the nature of algebraic geometry. There is a non-archimedian version
of amoebas which brings these ideas to algebraic varieties over other
fields. There is also a similar theory in higher dimensions. The notion
of an algebraic curve is replaced by the notion of an algebraic
variety, and the Newton polygon becomes a Newton polytope. Amoebas
provide a new way to visualize complex algebraic varieties. Looking at
an amoeba, one can see handles of complex curves and cycles in high
dimensional varieties, watch degenerations and build more complicated
varieties from simple ones.

<P> &nbsp; &nbsp;
The theory of amoebas is a fresh and beautiful field of research, still
quite accessible to a newcomer,  where exciting discoveries are still
ahead. The impressive results described above were obtained during a
short period of about 8 years by few people.   The first remarks belong
to I.M.Gelfand, M.M.Kapranov and A.V.Zelevinsky. Relations between  components of

 WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="18" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="images/img9.png"
 ALT="$ \Delta$"> have been discovered 
by M. Forsberg, M. Passare and A. Tsikh. 
The Spine of amoeba, Ronkin  function,
estimate of area are due to H.Rullg&#229;rd and M.Passare. Homological
interpretations and relations to real algebraic geometry are due to
G. Mikhalkin. 
I enjoyed the feast.

About
20 years ago I found a way to construct real  algebraic curves by a
sort of gluing curves to each other. I heard that  this gluing and use
of logarithmic coordinates in its description,  being replanted to the
complex soil, have motivated introduction of  amoebas. A version of the
gluing is used to glue amoebas.

  I was told that in mathematical logic amoebas 
  were known  for more than twenty years. However, they belong to an entirely
  different kind of mathematical microbes, and have never bitten me, so
  I cannot tell you about them.
