<H2>5.i. A counterexample to the original conjecture of 
Shapiro and Shapiro</H2>

The original conjecture of Shapiro and Shapiro was quite general and dealt
with the M-property for intersections of Schubert cells on a flag manifold.
Here is an <A HREF="Shapiro-letterI.V.html">excerpt</A> from a letter they
sent to Sottile describing it.
The original conjecture was also too optimistic, however, we believed it up
until we found a counterexample.
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the manifold of partial flags in <B>C</B><SUP>5</SUP>
consisting of a 2-plane <I>X</I> contained in a 3-plane <I>Y</I>,
consider the following enumerative problem:
Given general 3-planes <I>A,B</I>, and <I>C</I> and general 2-planes
<I>a,b</I>, and <I>c</I> in <B>C</B><SUP>5</SUP>, how many such flags are
there where 
<UL>

<LI><I>X</I> meets each of <I>a,B</I>, and <I>C</I> non-trivially, and

<LI><I>Y</I> meets <I>b</I> and <I>c</I> non-trivially, and it also
intersects <I>A</I> in a 2-plane?
</UL>

Shapiros' original conjecture in this case 
is that if <I>A,B,C</I> and <I>a,b,c</I> all
osculate a rational normal curve at distinct real points, then all partial
flags satisfying these conditions are real.
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;
The calculus of enumerative geometry for the flag manifold 
(for example, a repeated application of the Pieri-type formula of 
[<A HREF="Bib.html#sottile">So96</A>])
shows there will be 4 partial flags satisfying these conditions.
Worth noting about this problem is that 
<FONT COLOR=FF5555>it is the simplest enumerative
problem in a flag manifold that we cannot reduce to a problem in a Grassmann
variety</FONT>.
<P>

&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the Summer of 1998, we computed a few instances of this problem, and for
these, all 4 solutions were real.
Inspired by this, we tried to prove the conjecture in this case by computing
the discriminant of an equivalent polynomial system in some local
coordinates.
While studying the 
<A HREF="computations/counter/counter.disc">discriminant</A>, we noted 
that it is not always non-negative, which led us to factor it and look 
closer at examples
where the discriminant was negative.
In this way, we found a counterexample to Shapiros'
conjecture.
In this counterexample, the 2-planes <I>a,b</I>, and <I>c</I> in 
<B>C</B><SUP>5</SUP> osculate the standard rational normal curve at the
points 4, 1, and -5, while the 3-planes  <I>A,B</I>, and <I>C</I> osculate
at the points 0, -1, and 3.
