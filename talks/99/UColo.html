   In 1981, Brockett and Byrnes showed how the static feedback laws which
control a given linear system are determined through the Schubert calculus
of enumerative geometry.  This talk will describe that connection and
propose numerical homotopy methods to solve the resulting systems of
polynomials.

<P>
  The related questions of finding real feedback laws and of trying to 
do Schubert's calculus over the real numbers are intertwined with
a precise conjecture of Shapiro and Shapiro.  We discuss a new result which
shows it is possible to do Schubert's calculus over the reals and proves a
version of this conjecture.  In a similar vein, problems of enumerating
rational curves in the Grassmannian (also known as quantum enumerative 
geometry) may also be solved over the real numbers.
