  Algebraic Geometry is a regularly scheduled advanced
graduate class (once every two years) that lies between the
qualifier courses and topics courses.

   Algebraic geometry is a core mathematical discipline
that uses algebra to understand geometric objects.  Our
department has several faculty who work in the area or
use it in their work, including me, Lima-Filho, Landsberg,
Pearlstein, Matusevich, Rojas, and Robles.  Next year
we will be joined by Anne Shiu, and there are others
for whom familiarity with algebraic geometry is basic 
knowledge.   I point out that with Rojas, Landsberg,
Shiu and me, our department has a particular strength in
people working on the applications of algebraic geometry.
For example, I founded the SIAM activity group on algebraic
geometry and Landsberg is running a semester on this topic
at the Simons Center for Theoretical Computing.  With 
Robles and Pearlstein, we also have a strength in 
Hodge Theory.

   This course will follow an introductory text by Perrin
whose goal is Bezout's Theorem and the Riemann-Roch theorem 
for curves.  Fundamental concepts such as affine and projective 
varieties, sheaves, dimension, and cohomology will be treated.

   Grading will be based on class attendance (I believe that
advanced graduate courses should accommodate students with
differing goals), as well as a small amount of homework,
which will help you to become familiar with some basic objects
and concepts of the course.  Note the emphasis on small,
which I add for those reeling from qualifying courses.

  The course has a webpage:

The prerequisite is Graduate Algebra (it may be taken concurrent 
with 654).

Sincerely,
