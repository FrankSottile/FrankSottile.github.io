21e3.maple  Plots the curves with 3 singularities of type 21
                 - two identical curves, no crossings
21e2.111.maple  The curve with 2 claws and one planar flex   One Crossing
111e3.maple     The curve with 3 planar flexes               No Crossings

21e2.2.1.maple      There are two different ways to choose the singularities
                      Each gives 3 curves, 2 w/ crossing, one without

21e2.11.1.maple     There are two different ways to choose the singularities
                      Each gives 3 curves
21e2.1e3.maple      This has two different choices, and each gives 6 curves.
                    There are different numbers with a crossing.

                    a crossing, and the others have none.
21.111.11.1.maple   There are three different ways to make the choices.
                    One has a crossing, and the others have none
21.111.1e3.maple    There are two curves for every choice of singularity.
                    One choice has no crossings, while the other has one 
                    with a crossing and one without

21.11e3.maple       There are two curves, which are identical.  Each has a crossing
21.11e2.2.maple     This one might make a nice movie
                    These have either no or two crossings!
