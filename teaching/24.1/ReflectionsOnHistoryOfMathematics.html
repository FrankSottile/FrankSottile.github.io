  You will need to both email a .pdf to me at <TT><a href="mailto:sottile@tamu.edu">sottile@tamu.edu</a></TT> (or through Piazza; I think
  this works),   and submit this to turnitin.com. (directions in the future)<br>
<!--  Here is the information for our class:<br>
<font color=magenta>Math 629 History of Mathematics &nbsp; &nbsp; Class ID: 33187690&nbsp; &nbsp; Class Enrollment Key:

Please make your paper double-spaced (actually 1.3 or 1.5 will do), also 12 pt type for
  my old eyes, and a running head with your name and finally, page numbers and a title.  Thanks.

  <font color=red>A note about length:</font> I'd like to see papers of at least a couple of pages long; I suggest a lower bound of 1000
    words, to encourage you to choose to have enough space to develop your ideas, but also to signal that this need not be an all-consuming
   activity.<br>

 We have begun studying the history of mathematics now for six weeks, as well as trying our hand at doing mathematics from different
  historical periods, sometimes with the methods from that time.
  I expect that this is quite a bit different from your experience in other mathematics classes.
  The purpose of this short paper is to have you reflect on that experience; what you learned, what was what you expected, what was
 unexpected, how did this relate to your previous mathematics experience.<br>

  Here are some prompts that may help you begin to think about this assignment, you might try to address these, especially the third.
  
  <UL>
    
  <li>What was something you learned that surprised you.</li>

  <li>What was something that was challenging to you.</li>

  <li>What was something that <i>either</i> may be used to enrich your teaching (for those who are or have been teachers),
  <i>or</i> that changed or deepened your understanding of mathematics.</li>
</UL>

  This is the first time I have assigned such a reflective writing exercise; this is a bit of an experiment.
  Feel free to discuss this on Piazza.
