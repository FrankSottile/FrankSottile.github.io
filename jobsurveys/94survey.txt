Item #5   Curtis Bennett      Job Survey

I would like to do a survey on how subscribers to the YMN have done
on the job market this year.  This may give us an early idea as to 
how bad the market has been this year, although it will in no way
be a scientific survey.  If you could send me email answering the
following questions, I would appreciate it.  I will try and tabulate
results as soon as possible, but I don't expect to find the time very soon.

Thanks,
Curtis Bennett
