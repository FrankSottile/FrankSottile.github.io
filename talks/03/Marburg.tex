  Real algebraic geometry is a difficult subject.  Basic questions 
about some of the most elementary objects may not have answers that
seem satisfactory when compared to the answers obtained in classical 
algebraic geometry.  Nevertheless, it is a well-developed subject and
an important one as applications demand real solutions.  There are also
many hidden gems in the subject.

  In this talk, I will try to illustrate these remarks in a corner of the 
subject that I know well---real rational curves.  
For a preview of some of the talk, below are pictures of real rational 
curves in the plane of degree 4 with simple real ramification.

%The 5 curves with flexes at   $\{-3,-1,0,1,3,\infty\}$
%(Each nodal curve has 2 flexes at its node.)
%We indicate the differences in the parameterizations of these curves, labeling
% the flex at $-3$ by the larger dot and the flex at $-1$ by the circle.
