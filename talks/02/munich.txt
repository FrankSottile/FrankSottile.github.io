Enumerative Real Algebraic Geometry

Frank Sottile, University of Massachusetts

Enumerative Geometry is concerned with the number of
solutions to a structured system of polynomial equations,
when the structure comes from geometry.

Enumerative real algebraic geometry is concerned with
real solutions to such systems, particularly a priori
information on their number.  Recent results in this
area have, often as not, uncovered new and unexpected
phenomena, and it is far from clear what to expect in general.
Nevertheless, some themes are emerging. My intention in
this talk is to describe the current state of knowledge,
to indicate these themes, and to suggest lines of future
research.
