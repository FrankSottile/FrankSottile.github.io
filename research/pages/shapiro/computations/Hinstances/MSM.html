<H2>Maple Scripts</H2>

The data <I>m,p</I> in the table above are each linked to a Maple script
whose comments have a record of all computations archived.

Each of these scripts generate files that can be run to test instances of
Conjecture 1.
The Maple scripts generate a Singular file which contains many instances of
Conjecture 1 for that <I>m,p</I> as polynomial systems.
The values of <I>s<SUB>1</SUB>,s<SUB>2</SUB>,...,s<SUB>mp</SUB></I>
for each of these instances are generated in the maple script.
When the Singular script is run (It must be edited first!), it generates a
Maple script containg eliminants of the systems for each instance, computed
by a 2-step process, first 
computing a degree reverse lexicographic Gr&ouml;bner basis, and then with 
the FGLM conversion algorithm to compute the eliminant.
When this new Maple script is run (edit it first!), it checks that 
all zeroes of the eliminant are real.
If not, it prints an error message.
<P>
We use local coordinates which reduce the number of parameters by 2.
While this complicates the first degree reverse lexicographic Gr&ouml;bner
basis (Strange, that fewer variables slow the computation!), it greatly
expediates the computation of the eliminant.
