<b><font color="blue"> Title IX and Statement on Limits to Confidentiality: </font></b>

Texas A&amp;M University and the College of Science are committed to
fostering a learning environment that is safe and productive for all.
University policies and federal and state laws provide guidance for
achieving such an environment. Although class materials are generally
considered confidential pursuant to student record policies and laws,
University employees&mdash;including instructors&mdash;cannot maintain
confidentiality when it conflicts with their responsibility to report
certain issues that jeopardize the health and safety of our community.
As the instructor, I must report (per Texas A&M System Regulation
08.01.01) the following information to other University offices if you
share it with me, even if you do not want the disclosed information to
be shared:
<br>
<font color=maroon>
Allegations of sexual assault, sexual discrimination, or sexual
harassment when they involve TAMU students, faculty, or staff, or third
parties visiting campus.</font>
<br>

These reports may trigger contact from a campus official who will want
to talk with you about the incident that you have shared. In many cases,
it will be your decision whether or not you wish to speak with that
individual. If you would like to talk about these events in a more
confidential setting, you are encouraged to make an appointment with the
Counseling and Psychological Services (<a href="https://caps.tamu.edu/"><tt>https://caps.tamu.edu/</tt></a>).

Students and faculty can report non-emergency behavior that causes them
to be concerned at <a href="http://tellsomebody.tamu.edu"><tt>http://tellsomebody.tamu.edu</tt></a>.
