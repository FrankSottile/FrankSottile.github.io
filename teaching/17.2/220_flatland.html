   This is a <font color=matoon>W</font> class, and one way that we fulfill that
   attribute is by writing a paper.
   The paper we will write will be on a topic related to the book <i>Flatland</i> by Edwin
   Abbott Abbott.
   For this, I urge creativity.<br> <br> 

    <font color=maroon size=+2>Flatland</font>:&nbsp;
   The book <i>Flatland</i> is a classic that has piqued the imagination of readers for 130
   years.
   I want you to write a paper inspired by <i>Flatland</i>; there are many
    possible and legitimate directions to take.
   Simplistically (for the purpose of this paragraph), <i>Flatland</i> is both a social satire
   and an exploration of the meaning of space and dimension.
   One direction that you could take is to compare it to other well-known satires, either
   modern or classical, or both.
   You could use it as a <i>point de d&eacute;part</i> to discuss education, or class, or
   education of Women in either Victorian England or contemporary US or elsewhere.
   You could explore the parallelism between the experiences and fate of A. Square and
   historical figures, such as Galileo Galilei or 
   <a href="http://www.britannica.com/biography/Giordano-Bruno">Giordano Bruno</a>.
   You could explore its mathematical aspects, or mathematics that it touches on (geometry in
   higher-dimensional space).
   <i>Flatland</i> has inspired many other works, including other books, movies, and 
   articles, you could write about some of these, or about its affects on how people think.
   It is possible to argue a line from <i>Flatland</i> to special and general relativity.
   You could write additional chapters/sections for <i>Flatland</i>.
   The possibilities are limited only by your imagination.<br>
   I will expect multiple sources in addition to the book <i>Flatland</i>, and solely on-line
    sources will not cut it, unless you can make a good argument.<br>

<ul>
 <font color=maroon size=+2>Guidelines</font>:&nbsp;
 <li><font size=+1> This paper should exceed <font color=red>five pages and</font> 1500 words.
      You will need at least this much in order to do your topic justice.
      In past semesters, I have found that shorter papers are often too sketchy to 
      receive high marks.  If you happen to do an excellent job with fewer words,
      I could lighten this requirement, the standards will be quite high for that.
 </li>

 <li> Papers will be marked out of 160 points, with 10 points for timely and complete
       submission of topic and sources, 30 for the rough draft, 20 for the peer-review,
       and 100 for the final product.
 </li>
 
 <li> <b>Topic and sources:</b>  Give a (preliminary) title, and 
        a short (2 sentences to 1 paragraph) description of your topic, e.g. an abstract.<br>
        &nbsp;  &nbsp; <font color=blue>Historical/Expository</font> require multiple sources,
         several of which must be longer than the paper itself.  
        I want to see at least one source that is not a web page.
        Remember that items on the web usually have authors and titles, not just URLs, and need to be
         cited accordingly. 
         (Giving the date of access is also considered desirable, since the Web 
           changes constantly.)<br>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color=blue>Mathematical</font> papers or those that
        involve the creation of new <font color=blue>prose</font> need not have sources, if the paper is 
        self-contained, <b>but</b>
        they would be improved by your knowing something of the context.
        In fact an important part of a mathematical paper will be its introduction (for
        context if that is warranted) and the clarity/justification of any definitions.
 </li>

 <li> <b>Draft:</b> This will be handed in to Frank, who will look at them and
        make some comments.  While they need not be in final form,  they should be complete,
        and will be marked on that basis.
 </li>

 <li> <b>Peer Review:</b> We will spend one day of class time working in small groups to read
     and discuss your writing.
     Your drafts must also be handed in to members of your group.
    <!-- You are expected to come t class having read your partner's draft and be ready with constructive comments-->
 </li>

<li> Here is an approximate breakdown:


&nbsp;&nbsp;<table border=10pt>
<tbody><tr><th>Criterion</th><th>Expository</th><th>Mathematical</th></tr>

<tr><td>Choice of topic</td><td>5%</td><td> 5%</td></tr>

<tr><td>Correctness and depth</td><td>25%</td><td>50%<td></tr>

<tr><td>Exposition</td><td>35%</td><td>20%</td></tr>

<tr><td>Mechanics (punctuation, etc.)</td><td>25%</td><td>20%</td></tr>

<tr><td>References</td><td>10%</td><td> 5%</td></tr>

<!-- Re balance these: Topic 5%, Correctness and Depth 25%, Exposition 35%, References 10%, --
  -- Mechanics 25%  -->

</tbody></table>
</li>

<li> Don't expect perfect scores.  In serious writing the threshold of 
      perfection is infinite. 
</li>

<li><b>A note on Plagiarism:</b> 
   Finding information in books or on the Internet is praiseworthy; lying (even
    by silence) about where it came from is academic dishonesty. 
   Whenever you copy from, or "find the answer" in, some other source, 
   give a footnote or reference. Otherwise, you are
   certifying that it is your own work.
