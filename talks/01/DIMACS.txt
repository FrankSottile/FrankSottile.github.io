   DIMACS Workshop on Algorithmic and Quantitative Aspects 
   of Real Algebraic Geometry in Mathematics and Computer Science


   Enumerative Geometry is concerned with the number of solutions
to a structured system of polynomial equations, when the structure
comes from geometry.  Enumerative real algebraic geometry is concerned 
with real solutions to such systems, particularly a priori information on
their number.  Recent results in this area have, often as not, uncovered
new and unexpected phenomena, and it is far from clear what to expect
in general.  Nevertheless, some themes are emerging.   My intention in 
this talk is to describe the current state of knowledge, to indicate 
these themes, and to suggest lines of future research.
