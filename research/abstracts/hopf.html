<H2>Hopf algebras and edge-labeled posets
</H2>

Nantel Bergeron and Frank Sottile

     <P>
Given a finite graded poset with labeled Hasse diagram, we construct a
quasi-symmetric generating function for chains whose labels have fixed
descents.  This is a common generalization of both Ehrenborg's generating
function for the flag <I>f</I>-vector and a symmetric function associated to a
symmetric labeled posets which arose in the theory of Schubert polynomials.
We show that this construction gives a Hopf morphism from a
reduced incidence Hopf algebra of labeled posets to the algebra of
quasi-symmetric functions.
