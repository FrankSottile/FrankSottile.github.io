<b>Abstract:</b><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 
 In 1940, Luis Santal&oacute; proved a Helly-type theorem for line transversals
 to boxes in <b>R</b><sup><I>d</I></sup>.
 An analysis of his proof reveals a convexity structure for ascending lines
 in <b>R</b><sup><I>d</I></sup> that is isomorphic to the ordinary notion of
 convexity in a convex  subset of <b>R</b><sup>2<I>d</I>-2</sup>.
 This isomorphism is through a Cremona transformation on the Grassmannian of
 lines in <b>P</b><sup><I>d</I></sup>, which enables a precise description of
 the convex hull  and affine span of up to <I>d</I> ascending lines:
 the lines in such an affine span turn out to be the rulings of certain classical
 determinantal varieties.<BR>
