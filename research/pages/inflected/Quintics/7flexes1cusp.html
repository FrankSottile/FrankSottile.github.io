<H1>5.2 Maximally Inflected Quintics With 7 Flexes and one Cusp</H1>

<P> &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Here, we draw all the rational plane quintics with 7 flexes at the points
3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3 and one cusp at infinity.
There are 21 such curves in all.
However, since the set of ramification points is fixed under the involution
that sends <I>s</I> to -<I>s</I>, we may reparameterize any such curve
(reversing the direction of parameterization) to obtain another.
This either gives the same parameterized curve back (up to fractional linear
transformation in the plane), or it gives a different curve.

<P>
The images of the original curve and the reparameterization, as
unparameterized curves in the plane are identical.  
An artifact of the method we use for drawing such curves is that the 
reparameterized curve is the image of the original curve, reflected about 
some vertical axis.
Thus the curves which equal their reparameterization are symmetrical while
those which do not are asymmetrical.

<P>
Altogether, there are 3 symmetrical curves and 18 asymmetrical curves
with this choice of ramification.
(In fact, this decomposition of 3 and 18 persists for any similar symmetric 
(under <I>s</I> maps to -<I>s</I>) choice of the 7 flexes with a cusp at
infinity.

<P>
Below, we display the 21 curves.
We mark the positions of the flexes by <FONT COLOR=RED>red circles</FONT>.
Some curves have only 6 flexes displayed; the 7th flex is on the line at
infinity,
We indicate the positions of the solitary points by 
<FONT COLOR=GREEN>green crosses</FONT>.
Since, when forming a cusp, two flexes and one solitary point collide,
the `apparent' cusps with flexes nearby that are pointing at a solitary point,
are not cusps.  
The true cusps are bare and unadorned with nearby flexes and solitary points.
(The `points' at the top of the rightmost curve in the first row below
illustrate this.)

<P>
Some curves have a <FONT COLOR=MAGENTA>magenta line</FONT>
those curves have a pair of complex nodes, and the 
<FONT COLOR=MAGENTA>magenta line</FONT> is the real line on which the complex
conjugate nodes lie.
While this <FONT COLOR=MAGENTA>magenta line</FONT> appears to be tangent to
the curve, it is not.  (If it were, then it would have intersection number 6
with the complex curve, a quintic, and that violates B&eacute;zout's Theorem.)

We strongly urge the reader to print out this page, the 
<A HREF="7flexes1planar.html">page</A> consisting of quintics having  7 flexes and
one planar point, as well as the <A HREF="9flexes.html">page</A>
consisting of quintics having 9 flexes and compare the pictures. 
Lastly, the MAPLE files used to draw these pictures are found in the
subdirectory  
<TT><A HREF="7flexes1cusp.maple/index.html">7flexes1cusp.maple/</A></TT>.

<P>
Consider first the curves with two solitary points.
There is 1 symmetric such curves and 3 pairs of asymmetric curves, 
for a total of 7 curves with 3 solitary points.

There are nine curves with three solitary points, and four of these have a
complex node. 
In the last 4, one of the solitary points is hard to see, it is close to the
curve and partially obscured by the <FONT COLOR=RED>red circles</FONT> marking
the flexes.
