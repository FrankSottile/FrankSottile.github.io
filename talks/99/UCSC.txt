In 1981, Brockett and Byrnes showed how the static feedback laws which
control a given linear system are determined through the Schubert calculus
of enumerative geometry. This talk will describe that connection and propose
numerical homotopy methods to solve the resulting systems of polynomial
equations.

The related questions of finding real feedback laws and of trying to do
Schubert's calculus over the real numbers are intertwined with a precise
conjecture of Shapiro and Shapiro. We discuss a new result which shows it is
possible to do Schubert's calculus over the real numbers and proves a
version of this conjecture. In a similar vein, problems of enumerating
rational curves in the Grassmannian (also known as quantum enumerative
geometry) may also be solved over the real numbers.
