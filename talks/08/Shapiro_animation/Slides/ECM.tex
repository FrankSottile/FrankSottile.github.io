Given a system of polynomials\vspace{-8pt}
\[
   f_1(x_2,\dotsc,x_n)\ =\  \dotsb\ =\ f_N(x_1,\dotsc,x_n)\ =\ 0\,,\vspace{-8pt}
\]
with \DeCo{$d$} nondegenerate complex solutions, what can we say about its number, 
\DeCo{$r$}, of real solutions, (besides the trivial\vspace{-8pt}
\[
    d\ \geq\ r\ \geq\ d\mod 2 \in\{0,1\}\ ?\,)\vspace{-8pt}
\]
While the answer in general is {\sl nothing}, when the equations have special structure
coming from geometry, we can often say a great deal about $r$,
or the positive solutions, \DeCo{$r_+$}.\vspace{-8pt}

\begin{itemize}
 \item[$\bullet$] Sometimes, there is a smaller, sharp upper bound than $d$
 \item[$\bullet$] Often, there is a lower bound larger than $d\mod 2$
 \item[$\bullet$] In some cases the lower bound is $d$.\vspace{-8pt}
\end{itemize}

Discrete structures and combinatorics run through these bounds.

An integer vector $\alpha=(a_1,\dotsc,a_n)\in\Z^n$ \newline

\RawSienna{{\LARGE Lower bounds}}
\end{center}

Many geometric problems enjoy a non-trivial lower bound on their number of real solutions,
which is an existence proof for real solutions.

The most spectacular such bound concerns the number \DeCo{$N_d$} of plane rational curves
of degree $d$ interpolating $3d-1$ points in $\C\P^2$.
$N_1=1$, as two points determine a line.
Around 1990 Kontsevich gave the elegant recursion that starts with $N_1=1$,
\[
  N_d\ =\   \sum_{a+b=d} N_a N_b \left( a^2b^2\tbinom{3d-4}{3a-2} - 
           a^3b\tbinom{3d-4}{3a-1}\right)\ .
\]

If the points lie in $\R\P^2$, how many of the curves $C$ can be real?

\end{center}

The  Wronskian, $\mbox{Wr}:=\det|(\frac{d}{d t})^i f_j(t)|$ of
univariate polynomials $f_1(t),\dotsc,f_k(t)$ of degree $d$, has degree $k(d{+}1{-}k)$.
Up to a scalar, it depends only on the linear span of the $f_j$, and 
defines a map\vspace{-8pt}
\[
   \DeCo{\mbox{Wr}}\ \colon\ \mbox{Grass}(k,d{+}1) \ \longrightarrow\ \C\P^{k(d+1-k)}\vspace{-8pt}
\]
of degree the number of Young tableaux of shape $k\times(d{+}1{-}k)$.

A Young tableau $T$ is a linear extension of the product of chains of lengths $k$
and $d{+}1{-}k$ and therefore has a sign $\sigma(T)\in{\pm1}$.


\Brown{Theorem (Eremenko-Gabrielov).} 
If $W(x)\in\R\P^{k(d+1-k)}$, then \vspace{-8pt}
\[
   \# \mbox{Wr}_\R^{-1}(W(x))\ \geq\  |\sum_T \sigma(T)|\,.\vspace{-18pt}
\]

\Brown{Proof.} The degree of real Wronski map equals RHS \newline ($=$ sign-imbalance of product of
chains of lengths $k$ and $d{+}1{-}k$).

Soprunova and I began to develop a theory of lower bounds for systems of polynomials with
support $\calA$.  
Its first step was to formulate a polynomial system as the fiber of a map 
$\pi\colon X_\calA\to\R\P^n$ from a real toric variety $X_\calA$.\vspace{-4pt}

\begin{itemize}
 \item[$\to$] Give conditions on $\mbox{conv}(\calA)$ when $\pi$ has a degree.
 \item[$\to$] Give a method to compute this degree in a special case (foldable triangulations).
 \item[$\to$] Use this method to compute degree for polynomial systems from a poset $P$,
              where the degree is the sign-imbalance of $P$.
 \item[$\to$] Use this and SAGBI degenerations to give new proof of Eremenko-Gabrielov
              theorem.\vspace{-4pt} 
\end{itemize}

Joswig and Witte found many more examples coming from foldable triangulations.

\[
   \mbox{Wr}\ \colon\ \mbox{Grass}(k,d{+}1) \ \longrightarrow\ \C\P^{k(d+1-k)}\vspace{-8pt}
\]
that takes a $k$-plane of univariate polynomials to its Wronski determinant.


\Brown{Theorem (Mukhin-Tarasov-Varchenko).}
{\sl 
 If a polynomial $\Phi\in\R\P^{k(d+1-k)}$ has only real roots, then
 every $k$-plane in $\mbox{\sf Wr}^{-1}(\Phi)$ is real.

Earlier, Eremenko and Gabrielov proved this when $k=2$.

  A rational function with real critical points is real.
