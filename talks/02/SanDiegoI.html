<p><b>Abstract:</b> 
Gessel's enumerator of posets partitions may be seen as a
morphism  from a Hopf algebra of labeled posets to the
Hopf algebra of quasisymmetric functions. This map factors 
through a third Hopf algebra consisting of permutations, 
which was introduced by Malvenuto and Reutenauer.  This 
talk will describe the structure of this Malvenuto-Reutenauer 
Hopf algebra in detailed combinatorial terms. This description is 
obtained through careful analysis of the weak Bruhat order on the 
symmetric groups and their subsets of shuffles.
