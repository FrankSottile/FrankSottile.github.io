The aim of this paper is to introduce a new operation, called
switching, that takes a pair of Young tableaux $(S,T)$ such that the
outer border of $S$ coincides with the inner border of $T$, and moves
them through each other, yielding a pair $(S\sb T,{{}\sp S}T)$ such that the
outer border of ${{}\sp S}T$ coincides with the inner border of $S\sb T$.
It is shown that this operation is unique if one wants it to satisfy
some natural constraints. Moreover, similarly to the jeu de taquin,
the switching procedure consists in elementary steps which can be
performed in several ways without affecting the final result. As
particular cases, the authors recover algorithms introduced by Haiman,
Shimozono, James-Kerber and Remmel. Applications are given to
symmetric function identities. A final section discusses relationships
between switching and evacuation.
