Nonlinear Algebra

Nonlinear Algebra, which was the title of the Fall 2018 program at the
ICERM in Brown, refers to topics in algebraic geometry which underpin
many of its applications.   This course will adapt topics from the recent
book by Michalek and Sturmfels: "Invitation to Nonlinear Algebra".
(Copies may be found on the web).

There will be some homework assignments and also computational assignments.
Students will do a final project, presenting material from some research
papers, which could be their own. 

The prerequisite is graduate algebra or consent of the instructor.
