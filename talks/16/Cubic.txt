Cardano and the cubic

Frank Sottile

  You all know the quadratic formula for the solutions to a quadratic
equation.  What you may not know is that there is a formula for the
solutions to a cubic equation (and also for a quartic equation), due 
to the Italian mathematicans Tartaglia, Cardano, and Ferraro.  I will 
talk about these formulas, as well as the amazing human story of
professional jealousy and intrigue.   We will also learn how and why 
mathematicians became comfortable with `imaginary' numbers.
