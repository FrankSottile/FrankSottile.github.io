We give an elementary and characteristic-free proof that 
general codimension-1 Schubert varieties meet generically 
transversally in a Grassmannian and in some related varieties. 
This implies that the corresponding intersection numbers 
computed in the Chow (and quantum Chow) rings of these 
varieties are enumerative in all characteristics.
