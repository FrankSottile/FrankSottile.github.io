<P>
The Littlewood-Richardson problem for flag varieties/Schubert polynomials is
one of the outstanding problems in the Theory of Schubert polynomials.
Nantel Bergeron and I have been studying this recently.
In this talk, I will report on our progress to date, concentrating on the
role of Pieri-type formulas and the interaction of the combinatorics and
geometry of flag manifolds.

<P>
I will first discuss the situation for the classical flag manifold:
The Pieri-type formula, its relation to the combinatorics of the Bruhat
order, and some identities of the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.
The main porton of the talk will deal with our recent work on these same
questions for the symplectic flag manifolds.

<P>
Specifically, 
We give the formula for the multiplication of an arbitrary Schubert 
class in the cohomology of a symplectic flag manifold by a special
Schubert class pulled back from the Lagrangian Grassmannian.   This
formula is expressed in both terms of chains in the Bruhat order, and 
in terms of the cycle structure a certain permutations, showing it to
be a common generalization of the Pieri-type formula for the Lagrangian 
Grassmannian and that for the ordinary flag manifold.   Our proof uses
results on the Bruhat order, identities of structure constants and 
intersections of Schubert varieties.
