Certification for polynomial system via square subsystems

An important problem in numerical algebraic geometry is to certify
the solutions to a system of polynomial equations that is
overdetermined.  In this talk I will discuss approaches that
start with certified solutions to a square system and use
additional global information, including intersection theory and
liaison.  This is joint work with Timothy Duff and Nickolas Hein
