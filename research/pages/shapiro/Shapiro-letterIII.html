<P>

I will send you the written version later and I will state it now. 
Take an open Schubert cell in the space of complete flags which 
corresponds to uppertriangular matrices with 1's on the diagonal. Take 
any flag in this cell (say, corresponding to the identity matrix).
Consider its train, i.e. the union of all Schubert cells of positive 
codimension. The complement to its train contains several connected
components, in particular, one of the connected components is a semigroup  
coinciding with the set of all totally positive uppertriangular matrices 
(i.e. all minors which can be positive are positive). If you choose
another initial complete flag you still have a semigroup of 'totally 
positive matrices associated to this flag which is obtained 
by multiplication. 

<P>
Conjecture. If you take a sequence f(1),...,f(k) of complete flags in the 
open Schubert cell such that f(i) belongs to the 'totally positive' 
semigroup of f(i-1) (and therefore of all the previous ones) and 
state the necessary number of Schubert conditions at these flags you will 
get a totally real problem in Schubert calculus.
<P>
                                      Yours B.Sh.

   no longer relevant.</font><br>
