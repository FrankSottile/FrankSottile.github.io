<font color=maroon><h3>Week 0: &lt; 27 August 2018. </h3></font>
<ul>
 <li>  I am looking forward to working with you this semester.

 <li>Your first homework will be to send me a short autobiography:  Who you are, what is
  your mathematical and professional background, what do you do, what do you hope to get
  from this course, what library resources do you have available, have you ever taken a
  distance course before, etc.  Also, you may (optionally) include any other information
  that you feel is worth mentioning or telling me. The more
  information the better for me to get to understand you and what I can do to help you be
  successful in your goals (as they pertain to this class).<br>
  This will be due by the first couple of days of class, <font color=red>Wednesday, 29 August 2019</font>.
  Please send this by a private post to me on Piazza.
  If that does not work, then a simple email to my preferred email address
  <TT><a href="mailto:fjsteachmath@gmail.com">fjsteachmath@gmail.com</a></TT> should do.
  <br>
  You should also send me your preferred email address, as well as your home address (I
  may need to send you something this semester).
  <br>
  I likely will ask that you write a shorter version of this for public consumption by
  the class, posting it in Piazza.</li>

  <li>Getting on Piazza is also absolutely necessary.
  This is an on-line platform for course dicsussions.
  I have found it effective for this class, too.</li>
  
  <li>You need to <a href="studentguide06.pdf">download</a> the class text: <br>
    <i><font color=blue>A Survey of Mathematical Problems</font></I>,  by Harold P. Boas and Susan C. Geller.</li>
  <li> You will also need to get the collection of readings needs to be bought from Copy Corner, 2307 Texas Avenue  South,
     <br> &nbsp; College Station, TX  77840; phone 979-693-0640 and email <a href="mailto:classnotes@copy-corner.com">classnotes@copy-corner.com</a>.
     <br> &nbsp; The cost is $73.27; with tax it comes out to $79 + change (I bought a copy for myself). 
     <br> &nbsp; For the distance students, they will send you a copy by traditional mail or an electronic 
     <br> &nbsp; copy or an electonically downloadable copy. Vicki Ward, <a href="mailto:vicki@copycorner.com">vicki@copycorner.com</a>, is the 
     <br> &nbsp; person overseeing the "book" for this  course. 
  </li>

  <li><font color=maroon><b>Reading</b></font>: (for week one)
    <ul>
     <li>Chapter 1 of <i><font color=blue>A Survey of Mathematical Problems</font></I>

     <li>I will assign some problems from this in <a href="W01.html">Week 1</a></li>
