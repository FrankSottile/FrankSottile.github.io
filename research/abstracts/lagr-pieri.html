<H2>A Pieri-type formula for isotropic flag manifolds</H2>

We give the formula for the multiplication of a Schubert class on an
odd orthogonal or symplectic flag manifold by a special Schubert class
pulled back from a Grassmannian of maximal isotropic subspaces.  This
is also the formula for multiplying a type B (respectively, type C)
Schubert polynomial by the Schur <I>P</I>-polynomial <I>p<SUB>m</SUB></I>
(respectively, the Schur <I>Q</I>-polynomial <I>q<SUB>m</SUB></I>).  
Geometric
constructions and intermediate results allow us to ultimately deduce
this formula from multiplication formulas for the classical flag
manifold.  These intermediate results are concerned with the Bruhat
order of the Coxeter group <I>B<SUB>n</SUB></I>, identities of the
structure constants for the Schubert basis of cohomology, and
intersections of Schubert varieties.  We show these identities follow
from the Pieri-type formula, except some `hidden symmetries' of the
structure constants.  Our analysis leads to a new partial order on the
Coxeter group <I>B<SUB>n</SUB></I> and formulas for many of these
structure constants.
