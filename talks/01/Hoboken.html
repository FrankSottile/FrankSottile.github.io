<p><b>Abstract:</b> 
In the last (20th) century, two different groups of scientists were led 
to exactly the same question in pure mathematics, a problem of counting 
certain rational curves on a Grassmannian, that is, a particular 
Gromov-Witten invariant of the Grassmannian. 
The work of one group, theoretical physicists, spawned important 
mathematical activity including quantum cohomology. 
This story of mathematics inspired by physics is well-known, even though 
the physical motivation remains obscure to many mathematicians. 

<p>
The other group of scientists were engineers working in systems theory, 
specifically on the problem of dynamic feedback control of linear systems. 
While their story is less-known, their motivations for studying curves on 
Grassmannians are straightforward and their work leads to a very concrete 
understanding of this problem. In this talk, 

<p>
I will make the second story better-known, explaining how engineers were 
led to study spaces of curves on Grassmannians and some further mathematics 
inspired by their work, particularly, a recursive construction of solutions 
to this problem which shows that all solutions may be real.
