<P>
In this talk, I will report on the following joint work with Nantel Bergeron
of York University:

<P>
An <I>edge-labeled</I> poset is a graded poset, the edges of whose Hasse
diagram are labeled with integers.
While investigating the multiplication of Schubert polynomials, we were led
to associate a symmetric function 
<I>S<SUB>P</SUB></I> to every such poset satisfying a
certain symmetry condition on its set of maximal chains.
This gives a uniform construction of skew Schur functions, Stanley symmetric
functions, and skew Schubert functions.

<P>
For general (not necessarily symmetric) edge-labeled posets 
<I>P</I>, it is
natural to consider a quasi-symmetric generating function 
<I>F<SUB>P</SUB></I> for maximal
chains whose sequence of edge labels have fixed descents.
We show this gives a Hopf morphism from an incidence algebra of edge-labeled
posets to the Hopf algebra of quasi-symmetric functions.
We also show this generating function is a generalization of a generating
function for flag <I>f</I>-vectors defined by Ehrenborg and, for symmetric
edge-labeled posets, it coincides with the symmetric function of the previous
paragraph.
