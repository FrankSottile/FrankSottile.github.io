<B>Invariant approximation of differential invariants: an algorithmic
approach <BR>
Mireille Boutin, University of Minnesota

<P>

<B>Applications of the Groebner basis in statistics <BR>
Ian Dinwoodie</B>

<P>
 The Groebner basis has foundational and computational applications
in a variety of statistical problems.   Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, 
generating function methods,  parameter identifiability, and statistical
sufficiency can make use of the Groebner basis and these applications will be
described with practical examples.  Also, some ongoing work on high-dimensional 
models with incomplete data  will be discussed.

<B>Polynomial root finding using iterated eigenvalue computation<BR>
Steven Fortune, Bell Labs</B>

<P>
Computing numerical approximations to the roots of a univariate polynomial is a 
classic problem from numerical analysis and symbolic algebra.  I present a novel 
iterative algorithm that combines floating-point linear algebra with extended-
precision arithmetic.  Given a current estimate of the roots, the algorithm 
constructs a generalization of the companion matrix of the polynomial--actually an 
eigenvalue formulation of Lagrange interpolation.  The eigenvalues of the matrix, 
computed in floating-point with standard numerical methods, form the new estimate 
of the roots.  Surprisingly, even though the initial eigenvalue computations can 
be extraordinarily ill-conditioned, the iteration converges to approximations of 
the roots accurate to floating-point precision.  The algorithm has been successfully 
applied to very difficult polynomials, e.g. the Wilkinson polynomial of degree 600.  
In practice, the algorithm appears to be an order of magnitude faster than the 
best available alternative.

<B>Applications of Cartan's Moving Frame
Method to Classical Invariant Theory <BR>
Irina Kogan</B>

<P>
One of the central problems of classical invariant theory is the
problem of equivalence and symmetry of complex multivariable polynomials
under linear changes of variables. A non-traditional approach to this
problem has been proposed by Peter Olver in his recent book on classical
invariant theory. The main idea is to reformulate the problem as the
problem of equivalence and symmetry of submanifolds, by considering the
graph of a polynomial in <I>m</I> variables as a hypersurface in <I>m</I>+1
dimensional complex space. The solution for the latter problem can be
obtained using a classical tool from differential geometry -- Cartan's
moving frame method. We will discuss two algorithms arising from
this approach: the first one determines the symmetry (or isotropy)
group of a given polynomial, while the second allows to decide whether
two polynomials are equivalent (or belong to the same orbit).
Both algorithms involve Gr&ouml;bner basis computations, whose complexity
limits our ability to solve specific problems.
Nevertheless, some interesting new results were obtained,
such as classification of the symmetry groups of homogeneous cubics in
three variables, and necessary and sufficient conditions for a three
variable homogeneous polynomial of degree <I>n</I> to be equivalent to 
<I>x<SUP>n</SUP></I>+<I>y<SUP>n</SUP></I>+<I>z<SUP>n</SUP></I>.

<B>Solving the Selesnick-Burrus Filter Design Equation <BR>
John B. Little</B>
<P>

  The design of digital FIR filters is an area of signal processing
  where techniques from computational algebraic geometry are currently 
  being applied.  In particular, Selesnick and Burrus have developed 
  a system of polynomial design equations for filters by imposing a
  specified number M of flatness constraints on the passband in the
  magnitude response and a second number L of flatness constraints 
  on the group delay response.  In this talk, we will concentrate 
  on techniques for solving the Selesnick-Burrus equations in the
  difficult cases where M is large and L is small relative to M
  ("Region II" in their terminology) and illustrate how Groebner 
  bases, eigenvalue methods, and sparse resultants can be brought 
  to bear.

<B>Supernormal vector configurations <BR>
 Diane Maclagan, IAS
</B>

<P>
We introduce the notion of a supernormal configuration of
vectors in <B>Z</B><SUP><I>d</I></SUP>, which generalizes both unimodular and normal
configurations.  This is motivated by the study of lattice ideals arising
from three dimensional lattices, such as codimension three toric ideals.
Our main result is that when the Gale dual of a configuration is
supernormal, the Gr&ouml;bner fan of the corresponding toric ideal equals the
secondary fan.

<B> The Asymptotic Growth Rate of the 
        Mean Number of Equilibria of a Two Player Game<BR>
Andy McLennan, University of Minnesota</B>

<P>
      The applications of computational algebraic geometry to the
study of the computational complexity of noncooperative game theory
will be reviewed, with emphasis on the following recent result of Berg
and McLennan.  The expected number of Nash equilibria of a two person
game in which both players have N pure strategies has the asymptotic
growth rate 1.3253068<SUP>N</SUP>. As N becomes large almost all equilibria
have each player assigning positive probability to approximately
31.5915 percent of her pure strategies.  These results are obtained
by applying computational methods of statistical mechanics to a
formula for the mean number of Nash equilibria of a normal form game,
on a particular support, developed by McLennan.

<B>Deformations of commutative monoid algebras<BR>
James J. Madden, Louisiana State University Baton Rouge and 
Wesleyan University</B>

<P>

Let <I>k</I> be a commutative ring and let 
<I>B</I>:=<I>k</I>[<I>X</I><SUB>1</SUB>, . . . , <I>X</I><SUB><I>n</I></SUB>]/<I>I</I>,
where <I>I</I> is an ideal generated by monomials 
<I>X</I><SUP>alpha<SUB><I> i</I></SUB></SUP> and binomials
<I>X</I><SUP>beta <I>j</I></SUP>-<I>u<SUB>j</SUB> X</I><SUP>gamma<I><SUB> j</SUB></I></SUP>, 
with each <I>u<SUB>j</SUB></I> in <I>U</I>, the group of units
in <I>k</I>. 
Then <I>B</I> is graded by the monoid 
<I>S</I>:=<B>N</B><SUP><I>n</I></SUP>/~, where ~ is a monoid congruence determined by the
&nbsp; alpha<SUB><I>i</I></SUB> and the pairs (beta<SUB><I>j</I></SUB>, 
gamma<SUB><I>j</I></SUB>). If we change the
<I>u<SUB>j</SUB></I>'s, we get another <I>S</I>-graded <I>k</I>-algebra that may or may not be
isomorphic to <I>B</I> by a graded algebra map. The equivalence types of
graded algebras obtained as the <I>u<SUB>j</SUB></I>'s vary are classified by a
group <I>H</I><SUP>2</SUP>(<I>S</I>, <I>U</I>). 

<P>
In this talk will define this group carefully, show
connections with Harrison cohomology and with <I>A</I>-graded algebras (as
described in Sturmfels, <I>Gr&ouml;bner bases and convex polytopes</I>),
and exhibit computer calculations of <I>H</I><SUP>2</SUP>(<I>S</I>, <I>U</I>) 
for selected <I>S</I>. The
last suggests a combinatorial puzzle that (as of this writing) is not
solved. All of this machinery was developed in order to make examples of
ordered rings that answer certain questions in real commutative algebra.
I will sketch this application and exhibit a very peculiar ordered ring.

<B>Hypergeometric systems and embedded primes<BR>
Laura F. Matusevich</B>

<P> We propose a construction of rank-jumping parameters for a broad
class of toric ideals, which contains the generic non Cohen Macaulay toric
ideals.This gives rise to a question in combinatorial commutative algebra,
namely, to understand this class and characterize it in such a way that
examples are easy to compute.

<B>Sparse Resultants of Composed Polynomials<BR>
 Manfred Minimair (North Carolina State University)</B>

<P>
We talk on efficiently computing sparse resultants 
of composed polynomials.
By the sparse resultant of several sparse polynomials in several
variables 
(one fewer variables than polynomials) we mean an
irreducible polynomial in the coefficients of
the sparse polynomials that vanishes if they
have a common zero (in an appropriate space).
By a composed polynomial 
we mean the polynomial obtained from a given 
sparse polynomial by replacing each variable by a sparse polynomial.

<P>
We report on three results:

<DD>
H. Hong and M. Minimair, "Sparse Resultant of Composed Polynomials I",
<DD>M. Minimair, "Sparse Resultant of Composed Polynomials II"

<DD>M. Minimair, "Sparse Resultant under Vanishing Coefficients".

<B>Primary Decomposition of Zero-Dimensional Ideal <BR>
Chris Monico</B>

<P>
We present a new algorithm 
for computing the primary decomposition of zero dimensional ideals in 
polynomial rings over infinite fields. While the algorithm appears slower, in 
practice, than existing algorithms, it has several interesting features. In 
particular, if the ideal is given by a Gr&ouml;bner basis, the algorithm uses 
only elementary linear algebra and univariate polynomial factorization over 
the base field.

<B>Asymptotics from multivariate rational generating functions<BR>
Robin Pemantle</B>

<P>
Suppose a multivariate sequence has a rational generating 
function, F = G/H.  We want to obtain asymptotics for the coefficients
of F.  I will give several examples of this, then discuss a general 
method of computing the asymptotics, in which the singularities of
the zero set of H play a large role.  The chief hurdle in making these
the asymptotic computations effective is finding and classifying the
singularities of H.  I will discuss what measure of effectiveness of
computation is attained by current theory and software.

<P>
The Membrane Inclusions Curvature Equations describe the minimum energy
arrangements of <I>N</I> conical proteins embedded in an idealized cell
membrane.  We exploit the symmetries of the system to give two
reformulations which allow the successful computation of solutions up to
<I>N</I>=280 using current Gr&ouml;bner bases algorithms.

<B>Descartes' Rule for Trinomials in the Plane and Beyond<BR>
J. Maurice Rojas, Texas A &amp; M UNiversity</B>

<P>
A recent example of Bertrand Haas shows that a pair of real bivariate 
polynomial equations (where each equation has at most 3 monomial terms) 
can have as many as 5 roots in the positive quadrant.  However, until 
recently, the best upper bound on the number of roots independent of 
the degrees (following from more general results of Khovanski) is 248,832.  
We give an elementary proof that 5 is the correct maximum.  Our proof also 
generalizes to real exponents, systems where one of the equations has more 
than 3 terms, and counting connected components.

<B>Maximum Distance Separable Convolutional Codes,
      Constructions and Decoding<BR>
Joachim Rosenthal, University of Notre Dame
</B>

<P>
Convolutional codes can be viewed as submodules of <I>R<SUP>n</SUP></I> where
<I>R</I> is the polynomial ring.  Maximum distance separable (MDS)
convolutional codes are characterized through the property that
the free distance attains the generalized Singleton bound. By now
several constructions are known for MDS convolutional codes.

<P>
In this talk we will explain some of these constructions.
We also will present a new algorithm which is able to decode 
MDS or near MDS convolutional codes under some very weak
assumptions on the error pattern.

<B>The use of Groebner bases in the design of wavelets<BR>
Ivan Selesnick, Polytechnic University
Brooklyn, New York </B>

<P>
In this talk we outline the design equations arising in the
construction of wavelet bases and frames.
We describe several desirable properties wavelets should
have to enhance their utility in signal processing applications,
and how they are represented as design equations.
We then describe our experiences using Groebner bases to solve
the corresponding nonlinear design equations.

In particular, we consider the design of pairs of wavelet bases
where the wavelets form a Hilbert transform pair and
present new solutions obtained using Groebner bases.

Using Groebner bases in practice can be a challenge because of
the high computational and memory requirements. However, our
experiences and results support the utility of GBs in certain
cases.  But the effective use of GBs requires a knowledge of how 
to apply operations like GB factorization, the FGLM algorithm, etc.

<B>Mean versus random exponents for unitarily invariant probability
measures on <I>GL</I>(<I>n</I>,<B>C</B>)<BR>
M. Shub</B>

<P>

Abstract: The sum of the first <I>k</I> random exponents of a unitarily invariant
probability measure on <I>GL</I>(<I>n</I>,<B>C</B>) can be expressed as the integral of the log
of the determinant of the matrices over the Grassmannian of <I>k</I> planes 
in <I>n</I>
space. We show that this integral is a lower bound for the integral of the
sum of the <I>k</I> largest logs of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of the
matrices. A lower bound for the mean Mahler measure of the characteristic
polynomials of these matrices follows directly.

<B>Using Monodromy to decompose Solution Sets of
         Polynomial Systems into Irreducible Components<BR>
Jan Verschelde</B>

<P>
Homotopy continuation methods are numerically stable algorithms
to compute all isolated solutions of a polynomial system.
A recent application of these methods finds generic points
on each positive dimensional solution component of the system.
Using monodromy we can predict a classification of those generic
points along the breakup of components into irreducible ones.
Besides an increased efficiency, the new methods improve
the numerical conditioning of the multivariate interpolation
problem to generate equations for the components.
The performance of our new algorithms will be illustrated on
some well-known examples in science and engineering:
systems of adjacent minors of a general 2-by-n matrix,
the cyclic 8- and 9-roots problems, and the Stewart-Gough 
platform in mechanical systems design.
