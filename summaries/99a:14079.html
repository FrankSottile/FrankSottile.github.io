From the introduction: "Let $G\sb 1({<strong>P</strong>}\sp n)$ be the
Grassmannian of 
lines in ${<strong>P</strong>}\sp n$. For partitions $\lambda\sp
1,\cdots,\lambda\sp m$, let 
${\scr G}(\lambda\sp 1,\cdots,\lambda\sp m)$ be the (nonempty) set of points
of the Chow variety of $G\sb 1({<strong>P</strong>}\sp n)$ representing cycles arising as
generically
transverse intersections of Schubert varieties of types
$\lambda\sp 1,\cdots,\lambda\sp m$. Any generically transverse intersection
of Schubert varieties is rationally equivalent to a sum of Schubert
varieties; the Schubert calculus gives algorithms for determining how
many of each type exist. In $&#167;4$, we prove the following
theorem. Theorem A: Let $\lambda\sp 1,\cdots,\lambda\sp m$ be
partitions. Then there is a cycle $\Phi$ (depending upon
$\lambda\sp 1,\cdots,\lambda\sp m)$ whose components are explicitly
described Schubert varieties, such that $\Phi$ is in the Zariski
closure of ${\scr G}(\lambda\sp 1,\cdots,\lambda\sp m)$. Moreover, for each
cycle $X$ in ${\scr G}(\lambda\sp 1,\cdots,\lambda\sp m)$, there is an
explicit chain of rational curves between $X$ and $\Phi$, with each
curve lying in the Zariski closure of ${\scr
G}(\lambda\sp 1,\cdots,\lambda\sp m)$.

"Let Fl be the manifold of real flags which parametrizes real
Schubert varieties of fixed type. When $k={<strong>R</strong>}$, Theorem A has the
following consequence. Theorem C: Let $\lambda\sp 1,\cdots,\lambda\sp m$ be
partitions with $\vert \lambda\sp 1\vert +\cdots+\vert \lambda\sp m\vert
=2n-2$, the dimension
of $G\sb 1({<strong>P</strong>}\sp n)$. Then there exists a nonempty classically open
subset of $({\rm Fl})\sp m$ consisting of $m$-tuples of flags whose
corresponding Schubert varieties (of respective types
$\lambda\sp 1,\cdots,\lambda\sp m)$ meet transversely, with all points of
intersection real.

"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result showing that a
large class of nontrivial enumerative problems can have all of their
solutions real."<p>
