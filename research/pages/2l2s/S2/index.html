<P>
For the main proof in Section 3, we use a Singular computation in order
to factor an ideal. <BR>

This singular program which is explained in detail in the appendix
can be found <A HREF="Appendix.sing">here</A>. <BR>

Its output can be found <A HREF="outcompleterun">here</A>. <P>

Moreover, in the appendix one of the six factors of the main factorization
(resulting as output of the factorizing Gr&ouml;bner basis algorithm) 
is analyzed by hand.
Although the other components look somewhat similar, they also
have to be analyzed in the same way. <P>

For completeness, in the text file which can be found 
<A HREF="allcomponents.sing">here</A>
we carry out this analysis for <B>all</B> six
factors. Every factor describes two plane conics.
By symmetry, it suffices to consider one of the two conics in each
factor. <BR>
In fact, the text file is a Singular program. Although the main
steps in the analysis are done by hand, it was convenient
to put all these calculations into a Singular file. Namely, several
Singular steps serve to do some routine calculations and also to serve
for verification purposes. <P>
