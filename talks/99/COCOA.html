   The maximal minors of a generic rectangular matrix satisfy interesting
quadratic relations.  A reduced Gr&ouml;bner basis for the Pl&uuml;cker
ideal of 
these relations is elegantly described in terms of a natural Bruhat order
defined on the set of maximal minors.  This shows the maximal minors
generate an algebra with straightening law on this Bruhat order, and these
results are classical.


<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
   If we now consider a generic matrix of polynomials in a variable
<I>t</I>, then 
the maximal minors are themselves polynomials in <I>t</I>.  
The goal of this talk
is to describe a reduced Gr&ouml;bner basis for the ideal of algebraic
relations 
among these coefficients.  This will show that the coordinate ring of the
quantum Grassmannian (a singular compactification of the space of rational
curves in the Grassmannian) is an algebra with straightening law on a
quantum Bruhat order.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
   We will begin by reviewing the classical situation described above,
including some interesting geometric consequences of the reduced
Gr&ouml;bner basis for the Pl&uuml;cker ideal.  We will then describe a
reduced Gr&ouml;bner basis for the quantum Pl&uuml;cker ideal, indicate our
method of proof, and describe some consequences of these relations.  This
talk represents joint work with Bernd Sturmfels.
