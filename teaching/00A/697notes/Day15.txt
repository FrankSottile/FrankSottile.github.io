_______________________________________________

Theorem  (Refined B\'ezout's Theorem)
         Need K to be algebraically closed

Example (From Macaulay2)

Systems in nature have fewer solutions & challenge is to 
     find better bounds.

Elimination Theory.
  Theorem:  eliminants and roots

  Remark: Eliminants can be computed using a Groebner basis

  Shape Lemma.

  Resulting algorithm for solving & its numerical instability.

Homotopy methods

 Problem:  Find all isolated solutions to a system

 Step 1 find a homotopy that 
    I) interpolates between given system and 
   II) a trivial system, 
  III) so that all solutions are reached,
   IV) and we avoid singularities

 Step 2  Path-tracing

  Example: Predictor-Corrector

  Definition: Bezout Homotopy
              Optimal Homotopy
  
  Theorem:  Bezout Homotopy is optimal for generic systems.
