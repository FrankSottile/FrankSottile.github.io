Pieri's formula for the Grassmannian manifold describes the
intersection multiplicities for a Schubert cycle and a special
Schubert cycle. This formula also determines the expansion into Schur
functions of an arbitrary Schur function times a Schur function
indexed by a single row. In this paper the author presents a new proof
of Pieri's formula by explicitly describing a sequence of deformations
(inducing rational equivalence) that transform a generic intersection
of a Schubert variety with a special Schubert variety into a union of
distinct Schubert varieties. One of the main features of this
construction of rational equivalences is that it exhibits a branching
structure that parallels Schensted insertion and therefore other
combinatorial algorithms for Pieri's formula.<P><P>
