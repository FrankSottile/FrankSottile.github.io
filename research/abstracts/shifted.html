<P>
In his work on P-partitions,  Stembridge defined the algebra of peak
functions <I>Pi</I> which is both a  
subalgebra and a retraction of the algebra of quasi-symmetric functions. We
show that <I>Pi</I> is closed under  
coproduct, and therefore a Hopf algebra, and describe the kernel of the
retraction.  Billey and Haiman, in  
their work on Schubert polynomials, also defined a new class of
quasi-symmetric functions --- shifted quasi-symmetric functions --- and we
show that 
<I>Pi</I> is strictly contained in the 
linear span <I>Xi</I> of shifted quasi-symmetric functions. We show that
<I>Xi</I> is a coalgebra, and compute the rank of the n-th graded component.
