<H2>An excursion from enumerative geometry to 
   solving systems of polynomial equations with <I>Macaulay 2</I></H2>

Frank Sottile.

<P>
Solving a system of polynomial equations is a ubiquitous problem in
the applications of mathematics. 
Until recently, it has been hopeless to find explicit solutions to such
systems, and mathematics has instead developed deep and
powerful theories about the solutions to polynomial equations.
Enumerative Geometry is concerned with counting the
number of solutions when the polynomials come from a geometric situation and
Intersection Theory gives methods to accomplish the enumeration.

<P>
   We use <I>Macaulay 2</I> to investigate some problems from enumerative geometry.
Besides enumerating solutions to the resulting polynomial systems, which
include overdetermined, deficient, and improper systems, we address the
important question of real solutions to these geometric problems. 

<P>
  The text contains evaluated <I>Macaulay 2</I> code to illuminate the discussion.
This is intended as a chapter in a book on applications of <I>Macaulay 2</I> to
problems in mathematics.
While this chapter is largely expository, the results in the last section
concerning lines tangent to quadrics are new.
