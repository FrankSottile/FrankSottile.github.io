<P>
  We give an explicit natural identification between the quiver coefficients of
  Buch and Fulton, decomposition coefficients for Schubert polynomials, and the
  Schubert structure constants for flag manifolds. 
  This is also achieved in <i>K</i>-theory where we give a direct argument that
  the decomposition coefficients have alternating signs, based on a theorem of
  Brion, which then implies that the quiver coefficients have alternating
  signs. 
  Our identification shows that known combinatorial formulas for the latter two
  numbers give formulas for the quiver coefficients.
