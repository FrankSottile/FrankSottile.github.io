\item  Negate each of the following statements (which are important definitions in mathematics).
  Assume that the symbols $f$, $K$, $a$, and $l$ are defined.
  \begin{enumerate}

    \item  For every $x\in K$, if $x\neq 0$, then there is a $y\in K$ such that $xy=1$.
    \item  For every real number $\epsilon >0$, there is a $\delta>0$ such that if $x\in\RR$ with $x\neq a$ and $|x-a|<\delta$, then
      $|f(x)-l|<\epsilon$. 
    \item   For every real number $\epsilon >0$, there is a $\delta>0$ such that if $x,y\in\RR$ with $|x-y|<\delta$, then
      $|f(x)-f(y)|<\epsilon$.

\item For statements $P$ and $Q$ show that
  $\bigl(P \land  (P\Rightarrow Q)\bigr) \Rightarrow Q$ is a tautology.
  Then state $\bigl(P \land  (P\Rightarrow Q)\bigr) \Rightarrow Q$ in words.
  (This is an important argument form, called \demph{modus ponens}.)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item For statements $P, Q$ and $R$ show that
  $\bigl((P\Rightarrow Q) \land (Q\Rightarrow R)\bigr) \Rightarrow (P\Rightarrow R)$ is a tautology.
  (This is another important argument form, called \demph{syllogism}.)

  Give an example of a valid syllogism involving Socrates, and give an example of an invalid syllogism involving Socrates.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item For statements $P, Q$ and $R$ show that
  $(P\lor Q) \Rightarrow R$ and $(P\Rightarrow R) \land (Q\Rightarrow R)$ are logically equivalent.
  Can you show this without a truth table? 
  % Use the copy of a problem from last week at the bottom of this file to format a table, if you need one
  % If you do not use a truth table, be careful to make a coomplete and convincing argument, using other logical equivalences that we know
  % from class.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item   Define an open sentence $R(x)$ over some domain $S$ (not mathematical, but in words), and then state $\forall x\in S,\, R(X)$
  and $\exists x\in S,\, R(x)$ in words.

\item  Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be integers.
  Consider the following conditional statement:
  \[\mbox{If $a$ divides $bc$, then $a$ divides $b$ or $a$ divides $c$.}\]
  Which of the following statements have the same meaning as this conditional statement, and which are negations of this
  conditional statement:
  \begin{enumerate}
   \item If $a$ divides $b$ or $a$ divides $c$, then $a$ divides $bc$.
   \item If $a$ does not divide $b$ or $a$ does not divide $c$, then $a$ does not divide $bc$.
   \item $a$ divides $bc$, $a$ does not divide $b$, and $a$ does not divide $c$.
   \item If $a$ does not divide $b$ and $a$ does not divide $c$, then $a$ does not divide $bc$.
   \item $a$ does not divide $bc$ or $a$  divides $b$ or $a$  divides $c$.
   \item If $a$ divides $bc$ and $a$ does not divide $c$, then $a$ divides $b$.

\item   Give a definition of each of the following and then state a characterization of each.
 \begin{enumerate}
   \item  Two lines in the plane are perpendicular.
   \item  A rational number.

\item Give a valid definition of an odd integer.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 \item Prove that if $a,b,c$ are odd integers such that $a+b+c=0$, then $abc<0$.
   (You may use any well-known properties of integers here.)

   For each of the proofs here, sketch it first (perhaps in a table form), and then write it in paragraph form.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   %
   %  You may either format your table (preferred), or take a picture of it,  perhas calling it TableProb14.jpg and
   %   placing it in the folder with this file.
   %    (Any name will do, but it is better to not put spaces in the filenames, as some compilers complain. Many use underscore
   %      in place of a space.  Note that this is case-sensitive)
   %
   %  Use the following line and adjust the height, if needed:
   %
   %  \includegraphics[height=3cm]{TableProb14}
   %
   %  Note: any extension (except .eps for postscript) will be OK, the compiler will find the unique file that begins 'KnowShow5a'
   %  The command height can be changed if the image is the wrong size
   %                           (you might try to alter the image file (rotate it), if it is not horizontal

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item  Prove that if $a$ and $c$ are odd integers, then $ab+bc$ is an even integer for every integer $b$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Let $x\in \ZZ$.  Prove that if $2^{2x}$ is an odd integer, then $2^{-2x}$ is an odd integer.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Recall that for integers $m,n$ we sat that $m$ divides $n$, written $m|n$, if there is an integer $p$ such that $n=mp$.
   Prove the following statement:

     For integers $a$, $b$, and $c$, if $a|b$ and $a|c$, then $a|(b+c)$.
