   In 1981, Brockett and Byrnes showed how the static feedback laws which
control a given linear system are determined through the Schubert calculus
of enumerative geometry.  This elementary talk will describe that 
connection and discuss methods to solve the resulting systems of
polynomial equations.

<P>
  The related questions of finding real feedback laws and of trying to 
do Schubert's calculus over the real numbers are intertwined with
a precise conjecture of Shapiro and Shapiro, which we discuss.  
We also describe a new result which
shows it is possible to do Schubert's calculus over the real numbers and 
proves a  version of this conjecture.
