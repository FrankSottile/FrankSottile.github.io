Pieri-type formulas for maximal isotropic Grassmannians via triple
intersections. (English. English summary)
Colloq. Math. 82 (1999), no. 1, 49--63.
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
The author gives an elementary proof for some Pieri-type intersection
formulas. For this purpose he considers the Grassmannian of maximal
isotropic subspaces with respect to a nondegenerate bilinear form $\beta$ in
two different cases: (i) $\beta$ is symmetric on a $(2n+1)$-dimensional
complex vector space; (ii) $\beta$ is alternating on a $2n$-dimensional
complex vector space. A Schubert variety is defined by a decreasing sequence
of integers $n\geq µ\sb 1>\cdots>µ\sb n\geq -n$, where $\{\vert µ\sb 1\vert
,\cdots,\vert µ\sb n\vert \}=\{ 1,\cdots,n\}$. A special Schubert variety is
defined by a sequence whose only first term is positive. To each such
sequence corresponds a Young diagram representing the positive terms of the
sequence. The author uses this correspondence to describe the coefficients
appearing in the expression for the product of a general Schubert class, the
Poincare dual of the Schubert variety in the cohomology ring, with a special
Schubert class (Theorem 1.2). These coefficients turn out to be multiples of
2 as expected. Moreover, the author uses the same approach to find the
triple intersection of two Schubert varieties with a special Schubert
variety (Theorem 1.5).
