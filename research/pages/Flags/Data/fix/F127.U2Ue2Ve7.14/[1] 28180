17. OTHERACTIVITIESVALUE:
--
As I was extremely busy, I skipped other activities.
A missed opportunity, but my job was looking out 
after the TARAG programme.  The sheer scale of other
activities in the small MSRI building was extremely
disruptive at times.
--
18. WHATWASBENEFICIAL:
--
Bringing many people with common interests together for an extended period of time is the real genius of MSRI.  The discussion areas are great for collaborations and meeting with students/ postdocs.  I got very serious and useful work out of the computer facilities.
--
19. HOWWECANIMPROVE:
--
MSRI is trying to do quite a lot of things, and I feel that while it accomplishes much in this, it may not be doing any one activity as well as it might.  For example, the workshops from outside the programs disrupted our seminar enough to essentially kill it.  More resources to get people to stay longer would be good.  We has too many short visits.
--
20. FUTUREEVENTSUGGESTIONS:
--
Try to remove some of the administrative/budgetary burden from the organizers.  Hire a few more postdocs, maybe at the SAC's discretion to get people near to, but not in, a program.  Look for creative ways to get more people to stay longer periods.  The long-term (2+ month) visitors contributed a lot to the program, while shorter term visitors did not.

Hopefully have some more, newer machines.  You should undertand that I was a heavy user of about 40 machines
from March onward.
