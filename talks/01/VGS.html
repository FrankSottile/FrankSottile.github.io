<B>Abstract:</B> The following geometric problem has its origins in
computational vision: Determine the (degenerate) configurations of two
lines <I>l</I><SUB>1</SUB> and <I>l</I><SUB>2</SUB> and two spheres 
in <B>R</B><SUP>3</SUP> for which there are infinitely
many lines simultaneously transversal to 
<I>l</I><SUB>1</SUB> and <I>l</I><SUB>2</SUB> and tangent to both
spheres. 
We generalize this, replacing the spheres by quadric surfaces
in <B>P</B><SUP>3</SUP>. 
In this setting, the question has an amazing answer. 
Fixing the two lines to be skew and one quadric, the set of degenerate second
quadrics is a curve of degree 24 in the 
<B>P</B><SUP>9</SUP> of quadrics which is in
fact the union of 12 plane conics! Moreover, there are examples where
all 12 degenerate families are real. 
We describe the symbolic
computation behind this result and give some vivid pictures.
