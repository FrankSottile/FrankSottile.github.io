\begin{enumerate}  %  the \begin{..}  \end{..} stars and ends an environment.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item  Let $A=\{a,b\}$. How many relations are there on $A$?  If possible, do this without listing them.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Define a relation $R$ on $\NN$ (the strictly positive integers) by $aRb$ if $a/b\in \NN$.
  For $c,d\in\NN$, under what conditions do we have $cR^{-1} d$?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Let $A$ be a set with four elements, $|A|=4$.
      What is the maximum number of elements that a relation $R$ on $A$ can contain such that $R\cap R^{-1}=\emptyset$?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Let $A = \{p,q,r,s\}$.
      How many relations defined on $A$ are reflexive, symmetric, and transitive and contain
      the ordered pairs $(p,q)$, $(q,r)$, and $(r,s)$?
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Let $A=\{a,b,c,d\}$.
  Give an example of a relation on $A$ that is:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item reflexive and symmetric but not transitive.
    \item reflexive and transitive but not symmetric.
    \item symmetric and transitive but not reflexive.
    \item reflexive but neither symmetric nor transitive.
    \item symmetric but neither reflexive nor transitive.
    \item transitive but neither reflexive nor symmetric
  \end{enumerate}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Let $C$ be the set of all polynomials of degree at most 3.
    An element $f$ of $C$ can then be expressed as
    $f=ax^3 + bx^2 + cx+d$, where $a, b, c, d \in\RR$.
    Define the relation $R$ on $C$ by $p R q$ if $p$ and $q$ have a root in common.
    (For example, $p = (x-1)^2$ and $q = x^2 - 1$ have the root 1 in common so that $p R q$.)
    Determine which of the properties:  reflexive, symmetric and transitive are possessed by $R$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

   
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Let $R$ be an equivalence relation on $A = \{a, b, c, d, e, f , g\}$ such that $a R c$, $b R f$,  $c R d$, and $d R g$.
    If there are three distinct equivalence classes resulting from $R$, then determine these equivalence classes and
    determine all elements of $R$.
