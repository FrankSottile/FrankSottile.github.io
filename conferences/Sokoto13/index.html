<H2>Scientific Overview:</H2>

<P> &nbsp;   Computer algebra is both an active area of current research and a very accessible
  topic that provides an avenue for research in many related areas, such as algebraic geometry,
  real algebraic geometry, and computational algebraic geometry, all of which are foundational
  for the burgeoning areas of applications of algebraic geometry.   These areas are represented
  in conference MEGA (M&eacute;thodes Effectives en G&eacute;ometri&eacute; Alg&eacute;brique),
  the recent semester on 
  Algebraic Geometry with a View Towards Applications at the Institut Mittag-Leffler, and in
  the new SIAM (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics) activity group in Algebraic
  Geometry.   The lecturers for this school are all active in these areas and collectively have
  deep experience both as researchers and educators through the supervision of students;
  Ph.D. and postdoctoral, as well as the organization of and lecturing in short courses. 



<HR>
<H2>Scientific Program:</H2>

<P> &nbsp; This CIMPA Research School will last two weeks, and will have seven short courses of
  five lectures each, as described below.  
  These will range from foundational to provide background through more
  advances topics.   We plan to have lectures in the morning and just after lunch
  (approximately four hours each day) with afternoon exercise sessions, including computer labs to
  gain experience using open-source software.  In particular, we will demonstrate and the open
  source software <a href="http://www.geogebra.org/cms/">GeoGebra</a>, which maybe used for
  visualizing elementary geometry and algebra. 
  That will be run by Professors  Adamou, Morou, and Roy.  Each day of the research school will
  conclude with a more advanced research talk given by the lecturers and by some 
  distinguished Nigerian Mathematicians whom we will invite.  
This model of lectures, exercise sessions, and research talks has been used successfully at
  past summer schools.  

This school is aimed at faculty and advanced graduate students from Nigeria and
neighboring countries.  We are planning to have approximately 50 participants with 30 from
  Nigeria and 20 from other countries from Africa, particularly from Nigeria's neighbours, both
  anglophone and francophone.

<H2>Lectures:</H2>

<b>Prof.  Gabriel dos Reis</b>,  Texas A&amp;M University, Texas USA.
<font color="009900">Computer Algebra</font>.  


Computer Algebra is a delicate and wonderful marriage of theory and
practice: theory informed by computations, practical problems; and
practice grounded in well understood theory, leading to sound and
provably correct implementation.   These lectures will introduce
students to modern computer algebra systems, focusing on practical
matters and usage.


<br>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->

<b>Prof. Otto Adamou</b>, Universit&eacute; de Niamey, Niger. 
 <font color="009900">Computer algebra techniques for epidemiological models</font>.

 The study of equilibria in epidemiologic models leads to systems of differential equations
 with parameters. In order to make sense, the solutions should be real and positive. 
Techniques from semi algebraic geometry are useful to study some of these models.

<br>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->

<b>Prof. Maria Emilia Alonso</b>,  Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain.
 <font color="009900">Gr&ouml;bner bases and applications to cryptanalysis</font>.

We introduce  the  theory of Gr&ouml;bner bases and discuss some of the later and
more efficient algorithms to compute it. We give applications of Gr&ouml;bner basis algorithms  for
the computation of invariants in Algebraic Geometry and Commutative Algebra.  
Finally we present Gr&ouml;bner basis as a tool for Cryptanalysis, going into examples as HFE
 (hidden field equations) that seems to be somehow vulnerable to this attack. 

<br>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->

<b>Prof. Amidou Morou</b> Universit&eacute; de Niamey, Niger. 
 <font color="009900">Constructive algebra and relations with control theory</font>

This lecture will discuss applications of some deep results in pure algebra.  
The Quillen-Suslin Theorem states that a projective module over a polynomial ring is
 necessarily free.  
A projective module is stably free, and the algorithmic form of the  Quillen-Suslin Theorem is
 equivalent to the problem of unimodular completion:  given a vector whose components generate
 the unit ideal, find a matrix of determinant ome in which that vector is one of its columns. 
These lectures will introduce this problem and its algorithmic solution for Laurent rings, and
 explain some of its many applications to circuits, system control, signal processing, and
 other areas. 

<br>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->

<b>Prof. Moussa Seydou</b>   Universit&eacute; de Maradi, Niger.
 <font color="009900">Quantitative aspects of semi-algebraic sets</font>

In the lectures we recall some results about semialgebraic sets.  
We give some bounds on the topology and geometry of semialgebraic sets.  
These bounds are in general exponential in the number of variables used to define the set.  
We will present the quadratic case which is very interesting to study.  
For example the bounds for semialgebraic set defined by quadratic polynomials have a specific
 behavior in  contrast with the general exponential bounds:  they are polynomial in the number
 of variables. 
<br>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->

<b>Prof. Frank Sottile</b>, Texas A&amp;M University, USA.
 <font color="009900">Equations and Geometry</font>

Algebraic geometry studies the geometry that is described by polynomial equations. 
Because of this, computer algebra, and more generally algorithms provide tools for geometry. 
These lectures will introduce the basic dictionary between algebra and  geometry, the
 correspondence between ideals and varieties.  
The lectures will also introduce many basic examples which will help to understand this
 correspondence.   
The last lecture will introduce toric varieties. 
Toric varieties are class of algebraic sets which can be well-understood in terms of
 combinatorics, and which appear in many places in algebraic geometry and its applications.  
<br>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------->

<b>Professor Stephen Watt</b>, University of Western Ontario, Canada.
 <font color="009900">Software aspects of computer algebra </font>

 The topics of these lectures will include  the representation of data in computer algebra
 (including arbitrary precision integers, univariate and multivariate polynomials and
 matrices), dynamic memory management, the architecture of interpreters and compilers for
 computer algebra, type systems for computer algebra, formats for the exchange of mathematical
 expressions between programs, mathematical web services and handwriting interfaces for
 mathematics.
