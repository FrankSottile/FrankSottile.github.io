  Many enumeration problems in algebraic combinatorics lead to
quasi-symmetric generating functions, for example Schur functions,
P-partitions, and Stanley symmetric functions.  Some of these have been
shown to have interesting algebraic properties, most notably the Hopf
structures of Ehrenborg's quasi-symmetric generating function for the flag
f-vector of a polytope and of Bergeron and Sottile's generating function for
decsents in a labeled poset.

   This talk will describe joint work with Bergeron, Mykytiuk, and van
Willigenburg which gives a unified construction of most such quasi-symmetric
functions.  Our approach is motivated by work on the Schubert calculus for
flag manifolds and uses representations of the algebra of non-commutative
symmetric functions generated by what we call Pieri operators.
