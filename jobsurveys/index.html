<H3> YMN  job surveys:</H3>

From 1994 to 1997, at the end of the academic job season, 
the YMN has run a `snapshot' survey of
the job market that year.
From the completed surveys, the following information was
gleaned and compiled:

<UL>
<LI> Summary of the results - that is, statistics, to apply
the word loosely to our unscientific survey.

<LI> Anecdotes about the market:  "At my institution X, there
are 6 graduating students, 3 of whom have gainful employment
at this time..."

<LI> Comments on personal experiences during the job season.
These are lightly edited and grouped loosely according to 
subject.
They reflect the opinions of people on the front line of the
1990's academic employment crisis.
</UL>

The 1994 survey was conducted and compiled by Curtis Bennett.
The 1995-7 surveys were run by
