<H2>1.iv. History of the conjectures</H2>

Soon after Sottile obtained the results of his thesis 
[<a href="Bib.html#sottile">So94</a>], Boris Shapiro and Michael Shapiro
formulated a very general, but precise conjecture, which dealt with this
phenomenon of reality in enumerative geometry for Grassmannians.
(<a href="Shapiro-letterI.html">Here</a> are excerpts from letters
giving more information.)
Their conjecture was also concerned with the flag manifold.
As stated, it is false - we describe a 
<a href="SectV.1.html">counterexample</a> later.

Restricting their conjecture to Grassmannians shows a relation to part of
the static pole placement problem of linear systems theory.
This relation is described in more detail in 
[<a href="Bib.html#sottile">So98</a>]. 
While studying the pole placement problem numerically 
[<a href="Bib.html#RS">RS</a>], Rosenthal and
Sottile decided to test some instances of the conjecture of Shapiro and
Shapiro.
Much to their surprise, the computations were all in agreement with the 
conjecture.
(<a href="http://www.nd.edu/~rosen/pole/index.html">Here</a> is a description
of that project.)

In the aftermath of those computations, restricted versions of the
conjecture have appeared in print [<a href="Bib.html#RS">RS</a>,
<a href="Bib.html#sottile">So97c</a>,<a href="Bib.html#HSS">HSS</a>].
Also, Sottile distributed two challenges to the systems solving community.
One concerned `<a href="hypersurface.txt">hypersurface</a>' Schubert
conditions (see <A Href="SectII.html">Section 2</A>), and the second concerned
`<a href="Pieri.txt">Pieri-type</a>' Schubert conditions (see 
<A Href="SectIII.html">Section 3</A>).
A spectacular symbolic computation of Faug&egrave;re, Rouillier, and
Zimmermann [<A HREF="Bib.html#FRZ">FRZ</A>] was in response to these
challenges.
They verified one instance of the conjecture involving the 462 4-planes
meeting 12 3-panes in 7-space.
This renewed Sottile's interest in these conjectures and inspired the recent
work.
To the best of our knowledge, this document and the paper 
[<A HREF="Bib.html#sottile">So98</A>] mark the debut in print of the most
general version of the conjecture of Shapiro and Shapiro.
