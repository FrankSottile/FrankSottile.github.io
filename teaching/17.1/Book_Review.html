<br>

Your first paper is a review of a book that contains both 
<b>a nontrivial amount of history and a nontrivial amount of mathematics</b>.<br>
There are many (perhaps too many) possibilities.
This could be, for example
<ul>
  <li> a biography of a mathematician, such as <br>
   S. Nasar, <i>A Beautiful Mind:  Biography of John Nash, Jr</i>, or <br>
   S. Batterson,  <i>Stephen Smale</i>.
  </li>

  <li> a memoir or autobiography, such as <br>
   G.H. Hardy, <i>A Mathematician's Apology</i>, or <br>
   P. Halmos, <i>I Want to be a Mathematician</i>.
  </li>

  <li> a history of a branch of mathematics, such as <br>
    Carl Boyer, <i>The History of Calculus and its Conceptual Development</i>.
  </li>

  <li> a history of a particular period of mathematics, such as <br>
     Frank J. Swetz, <i>Capitalism and Arithmetic: The new math of the 15<sup>th</sup> Century</i>, or<br>
     J.L. Berggren, <i>Episodes in the Mathematics of Medieval Islam</i>.
  </li>

  <li> a story of a particular mathematical development, such as <br>
       David Bressoud, <i>Proofs and Confirmations: the story of the alternating sign matrix conjecture</i>, or <br>
       J.W. Dauben, <i>Abraham Robinson;  the creation of non-standard analysis, a personal and mathematical odyssey</i>.
    </li>

  <li> Liping Ma's book ......</li>
  
</ul>

This is by no means exhaustive, even of the types of books that are available.
I just went through the list of books in my library [it is in storage in boxes in Texas] and picked out a few (of about 50 on history and
biography) that are representative.  
I have read all of these sometime in the past 35 years.

 More extensive lists appear on the course pages of my predecessors, 
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://calclab.math.tamu.edu/~fulling/m629/bookrevu.html">S. Fulling</a>  (this page is based on his)
  </li>
  <li>
   <a href="http://distance-ed.math.tamu.edu/math629_10C/bookreport.htm">G. D. Allen</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.math.tamu.edu/%7Egeller/math629/bookreportf05.html">S. Geller</a>
  </li>
</ul>

Unlike Allen and Geller, I do not require you to each choose different books.
A list of specialty online bookstores is on Fulling's 
<a href="http://calclab.math.tamu.edu/%7Efulling/m629/links.html">Links</a> page.<br>
Some of these books may be available from a local library or through other electronic resources.

Please let me know (short email to <a href="mailto:sottile@math.tamu.edu"><tt>sottile@math.tamu.edu</tt></a> or via Piazza) which book
you plan to review.
We can also discuss this.
Get to this soon.<br><br>

Further:

<ul>
  <li>
    The books listed above on the pages of my predecessors vary in level, including level of scholarship and mathematical maturity required.
    On the low end of both is the engaging  "Men of Mathematics" by E.T. Bell (who also wrote
    science fiction in the 1920's, but was a math professor at Cal Tech&mdash; Constance Reid (Sister of the famous mathematician Julia
  Robinson) wrote an intriguing biography of E.T. Bell, and has nice biographies of other mathematicians.).
  </li>
  <li>
    Most of you are teachers or parents or both.  If you read a book 
   intended for a popular or juvenile audience, write your review from the 
    perspective "I do/don't recommend this book for students at level X."
  </li>

  <li>  Several of the biograpies contain references that delve into 
      the mathematics at a  more technical level (for example, the subject's actual research papers).
     Maybe you could follow up some of those leads.
  </li>

  <li>The review is due 22 February 2017, it is to be at least 1000 words long, and will be handed in both to turnitin.com, as well as emailed to my
      teaching email: <TT><a href="mailto:fjsteachmath@gmail.com">fjsteachmath@gmail.com</TT></a>.<br>
  I will mark it both for content and for quality of writing, but more the first than the second.
  </li>
</ul>
