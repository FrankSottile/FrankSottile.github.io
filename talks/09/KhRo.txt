Khovanskii-Rolle continuation for real solutions

   Continuation methods are numerical algorithms which
find all solutions to a system of polynomials by numerically
tracing curves.  Well-known are homptopy methods, where
the curves arise from degenerations of the system, connecting
solutions to the original system to those for simpler systems.

   With Dan Bates, we propose a different method which is based on
Khovanskii's generalization of Rolle's theorem and the
notion of Gale duality for polynomial systems.  Unlike
homotopy continuation, this algorithm only finds real-number
solutions and its complexity depends only on the number
of real solutions, and not on the algebraic degree of the 
equations.

   In this talk, I will sketch the main ideas in this new 
algorithm and show how it works in an implementation that
we have made which is restricted to Gale-dual systems in the plane.
