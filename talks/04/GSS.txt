Convexity for lines in R^d
Frank Sottile

  Convex subsets in R^d play an important role in Discrete and
Computational Geometry.  A cornerstone of the theory of convexity is
Helly's Theorem from 1923 which states that if there is a point in
common to every d+1 (or fewer) members of a finite collection of
convex sets in R^d, then the whole family has a point in common. The
usefulness of such a basic numerical result led to a search for
similar results for other objects besides points, for example line
transversals to convex sets in R^d.  While that is impossible in
general, in 1940 Santalo proved a Helly-type result for line
transversals to boxes in R^d.


   This talk will describe these foundational results in Convex
Geometry and discuss how an analysis of Santalo's arguments leads
to a new and very pleasing convexity structure on ascending lines in
R^d, one that is related to some interesting geometry of the
Grassmannian of lines.  For example, the two pictures above are
the convex hull of two lines in R^3 (on the left) and the convex
hull of three lines (on the right).
