Toric compactification of periodic graph operators

A periodic  graph is  a discretization of  a crystal,  with difference
operators  being the  analog  of the  Schroedinger  equation.  In  the
1990's    Gieseker,    Knorrer,    and   Trubowicz    used    toroidal
compactifications  to  study  operators  for a  particular  family  of
2-dimensional   periodic   graphs.    Since  then,   the   theoretical
underpinnings   of   toric   varieties  has   advanced   considerably.
Similarly, many researchers in mathematical  physics have begun to use
some aspects of toric varieties  and more generally algebraic geometry
and commutative algebra in their work.

In this talk, I will sketch some of the algebraic-geometric aspects of
periodic graph  operators, and then discuss  how some of these  may be
extended  to  certain projective  toric  varieties  associated to  the
operator.  This  is joint  work with Matthew  Faust, Jordy  Lopez, and
Stephen Shipman.
