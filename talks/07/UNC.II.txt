Optimal fewnomial bounds from Gale dual polynomial systems

 In 1980, Askold Khovanskii established his fewnomial bound 
 for the number of real solutions to a system of polynomials, 
 showing that the complexity of the set of real solutions to 
 a system of polynomials depends upon the number of monomials 
 and not on the degree.  This fundamental finiteness result 
 in real algebraic geometry is believed to be unrealistically large.

 I will report on joint work with Frederic Bihan on a new 
 fewnomial bound which is substantially lower than Khovanskii's
 bound and asymptotically optimal.  This bound is obtained by
 first reducing a given system to a Gale system, and then 
 bounding the number of solutions to a Gale system.  Like 
 Khovanskii's bound, this bound is the product of an exponential 
 function and a polynomial in the dimension, with the exponents 
 in both terms depending upon the number of monomials.  In our 
 bound, the exponents are smaller than in Khovanskii's.
