What Is a Real Algebraic Curve? 

Abstract:

 A real algebraic plane curve is the set of real solutions to a
polynomial equation f(x,y)=0. Their topology and classification was one of
Hilbert's problems in 1900, and their study continues to be an active area of
mathematical research. For example, plane curves will play a major role in
Winter/Spring 2004 program at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute on
Topological aspects of real algebraic varieties. This talk will introduce you to
them and to the beginnings of their study.
