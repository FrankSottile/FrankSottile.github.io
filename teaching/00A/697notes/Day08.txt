Generic properties of varieties

 - Theorem relating Zariski topology to usual (Euclidean) topology
    * Z-closed/open ==> E-closed/open
    * Non-empty & E-open ==> Z dense
    * Z closed, not all space ==> nowhere E dense
    * R^n is Z_closed in C^n   

 - Example of A^1
 - Definition of generic subset
 - Generic matrix is invertible
 - Generic polynomial has n distinct roots
 - Discriminant

Unique Factorization for Varieties

 - Recall unique factorization for polynomials
 - Hilbert Basis Theorem
 - Def.  reducible/ireducible
 - Def.  prime ideal
 - Hypersurface V(f) is irreducible if and only if f is irreducble
 - An affine variety is irreducible if and only if its ideal is prime
 
 - Theorem:  Affine varieties are finite unions of irreducibles

 - Irredundant decomposition  (Compare to polynomials)
 -  Fact: irreducible complex varieties are connected

Regular and Rational functions

 - Def.  Regular function
 -       Coordinate ring

 - Theorem.  For an algebraically closed field,
      Coordinate rings are precisely the finitely generated
      algebras without nilpotents.
