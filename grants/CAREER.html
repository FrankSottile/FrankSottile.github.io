<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Sottile  will work on projects ranging from research in algebraic geometry and algebraic combinatorics, to strengthening links between algebraic geometry and applied  science, to educational outreach.  His work in algebraic geometry will focus  on concrete aspects of flag manifolds and their Schubert varieties, involving a range  of problems  from the  real Schubert calculus,  from extensions  of  quantum  Schubert calculus,  from combinatorial  problems in Schubert  calculus, and  from  the geometry  of Schubert  varieties.  This  will deepen  our understanding  of computation, combinatorics,  and real-number phenomena  in algebraic   geometry.  Sottile will study structural properties of certain combinatorial  Hopf algebras, work that has  applications to polytopes, to the  Schubert calculus, and to certain  combinatorial   schemes in  physics. He  is  actively engaged  in applications   of  computational  algebraic geometry  to   other fields,particularly discrete geometry and  the applied sciences. A unifying theme in  this scientific work  is studying  concrete mathematical objects using computer experimentation to inform theoretical work.<P> While  algebraic geometry is  concerned  with  abstract  questions about solutions to equations,  its value to other disciplines  is largely through concrete  objects and computational tools.  A major activity of this project is  to help disseminate  the  modern  computational  tools from  algebraic geometry to other fields,  including the applied sciences, through research collaboration, organizing  conferences,  and  co-authoring a  textbook  on algebraic  geometry for applied scientists.  Sottile will  also organize an outreach program for talented high school students in Western Massachusetts with the particular  goal of serving the needs of  students in nearby urban areas,  many of  whom come from groups  traditionally  underrepresented in science.   The  intention  of this  work:  the  research,  the  technology transfer, the service and the outreach, is to provide a firm foundation for a lifetime of integrated research and educational activities for Sottile.<P>
