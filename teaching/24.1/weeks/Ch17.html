&nbsp; &nbsp;  I am also assigning reading about differential geometry and curvature, but not yet assigning many homework problems from it.
This topic naturally follows mechanics and mechanical curves.
   <li>
    Chapter 17 in Stillwell's book.
    While differential geometry is a 19th century topic, this can be read just after Chapter 13 (next week, we do the three in between).
    </li> 
    <li>Watch the Numberphile video about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-TBlh44gY">curvature and eating Pizza</a>.</li>
     <li>With your second paper coming due, I will not assign  problems from Chapter 17, for now.</li>
