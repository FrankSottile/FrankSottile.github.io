Math 662: Seminar in Algebra
Title:  Toric varieties, Grassmannians, and applications

   Among the most accessible classes of algebraic varieties
are toric varieties and homogeneous spaces, specifically
Grassmannians.   This is fortunate for these are also among
the most commonly encountered outside of algebraic geometry 
within mathematics and in the applications of algebraic 
geometry.  Toric varieties in particular are currently
widely studied in algebraic geometry and its applications.

   This course would introduce the students to these two 
classes of varieties, emphasizing their fundamental 
combinatorial nature while focusing on concrete examples
and explaining some of their applications.  Approximately 
2/3 would be concerned with toric varieties and 1/3 with 
Grassmannians and other homogeneous spaces.

  Because of the elementary nature of these varieties,
the prerequisite will be graduate algebra, although 
courses in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry
will be helpful.
