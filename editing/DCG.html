<P>
There is an established and active interaction between Discrete
Geometry and Algebraic Combinatorics. Convex polytopes, monomial
ideals, oriented matroids, order complexes, hyperplane arrangements,
and semi-algebraic sets are good examples of geometric objects that
carry rich combinatorial information and  provide challenging
enumerative and algebraic questions.  We invite submissions for a
special issue in this subject area.

<P>

Topics of particular interest include, but are not limited to,
f-vectors of polyhedral complexes, algebraic aspects of f-vectors,
chamber complexes, triangulations of
convex polytopes, extension spaces, subspace arrangements, splines, 
zonotopal tilings, semi-algebraic geometry, Grassmannians and flag
manifolds, and toric varieties.


<P>
It is timely to provide a common forum for some of the most recent
results in geometric combinatorics. This special issue of  the journal
<A HREF="http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00454/index.htm"><I>Discrete
and Computational Geometry</I></A> accompanies  
two forthcoming events in California. The 
special session on 
<A HREF="http://www.ams.org/amsmtgs/2066_special.html">Algebraic and 
     Geometric Combinatorics</A> at 
<A HREF="http://www.ams.org/amsmtgs/2066_program.html">2000 Fall Western 
     Section Meeting of the AMS</A> at San Francisco State University
(October 21-22, 2000) and the 
"Bay Area Discrete Math Reunion" at 
<A HREF="http://www.math.ucdavis.edu/">University of California 
at Davis</A> (October 20, 2000). 
If you intend to make a submission to this special issue
please let us know by the end of October 2000.

<P>

Papers should be submitted to Jes&uacute;s De Loera or Frank Sottile (see
information below).  The preferred form of submission is electronic,
with LaTeX-2e as the preferred file format. Following is the time table
