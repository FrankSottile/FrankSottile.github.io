<P>
Two well-defined classes of structured polynomial systems have been studied
from this point of view--sparse systems, where the structure is encoded by the
monomials in the polynomials <I>f<SUB>i</SUB></I>--and geometric systems,
where the structure comes from geometry.
This second class consists of polynomial formulations of enumerative 
geometric problems, and in this case 
Question&nbsp;<A HREF="1.html#q:one">1.1</A> is the motivating question of
enumerative real algebraic geometry, the subject of this survey.
Treating both sparse polynomial systems and enumerative geometry
together in the context of 
Question&nbsp;<A HREF="1.html#q:one">1.1</A> gives useful insight.

<P>
Given a system of polynomial 
equations&nbsp;<A HREF="1.html#eq:polysys">(1.1)</A> with <I>d</I>
complex solutions, we know the following easy facts about its number 
<I>r</I>  of real solutions.
<BR>
<DIV ALIGN="RIGHT">

<TABLE WIDTH="100%" ALIGN="CENTER">
<TR VALIGN="MIDDLE"><TD ALIGN="CENTER" NOWRAP><A NAME="eq:easy-bounds"></A>
<TABLE>
  <TR><TD> We have <I>r</I> < <I>d, &nbsp; and</TD></TR>
  <TR><TD rowspan=2 align=center>
     since <I>d</I>-<I>r</I> is an even integer, we have that
   <I>r</I> is at least &nbsp;</TD>
         <TD> 0&nbsp; &nbsp; if <I>d</I> is even</TD></TR>
            <TR><TD> 1&nbsp; &nbsp; if <I>d</I> is odd</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<TD WIDTH=10 ALIGN="RIGHT">
(1.2)</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV>
In a surprising number of cases, much better information than this is known.

<P>
Structured systems occur in families of systems sharing the same structure.
The common structure determines the number <I>d</I>
of complex solutions to a general member of the family.  
We assume throughout that a general system in any family has
only simple solutions in that each complex solution occurs without
multiplicity. 

<P>
Given such a family whose general member has <I>d</I>
complex solutions, perhaps the ultimate answer to our motivating question is  
to determine exactly which numbers <I>r</I>
of real solutions can occur and also
which systems have a given number of real solutions.
Because this level of knowledge may be unattainable, we will be satisfied
with less knowledge.

<P>
For example, are the trivial bounds given 
in&nbsp;<A HREF="1.html#eq:easy-bounds">(1.2)</A> sharp?
That is, do there exist systems attaining the maximal and minimal number of
real solutions allowed by&nbsp;<A HREF="1.html#eq:easy-bounds">(1.2)</A>?
If these bounds are not sharp, do there exist better sharp bounds?
Perhaps we are unable to determine sharp bounds, but can exhibit systems in a
family with many (or few) real solutions.
This gives lower bounds on the maximum number of real solutions to a system in
a family (or upper bounds on the minimum number).

<P>
These answers have two parts: bounds and constructions.
We shall see that bounds (or other limitations) often come from topological 
considerations. 
On the other hand, the constructions often come by deformations from/to a
degenerate situation.
In enumerative geometry, this is the classical technique of special position,
while for sparse systems, it is Viro's method of toric deformations.

<P>
In <A HREF="../S2/index.html">Section 2</A> we discuss sparse polynomial systems
from the point of view of  
Question&nbsp;<A HREF="#q:one">1.1</A>.
The heart of this survey begins in 
<A HREF="../S3/index.html">Section 3</A>, where we discuss some of the
myriad examples of enumerative geometric problems that have been studied from
this perspective. 
In particular, for many enumerative problems the upper
bound&nbsp;<A HREF="#eq:easy-bounds">(1.2)</A> is sharp.
In <A HREF="../S4/index.html">Section 4</A>, we concentrate on enumerative
problems from the Schubert calculus, where much work has been done on this
question of real solutions.
<A HREF="../S5/index.html">Section 5</A> is devoted to a conjecture of Shapiro and
Shapiro, whose study has led to many recent results in this area.
Finally, in <A HREF="../S6/index.html">Section 6</A> we describe new ideas of
Eremenko and Gabrielov giving lower bounds better than&nbsp;<A
HREF="#eq:easy-bounds">(1.2)</A> for some enumerative problems.
