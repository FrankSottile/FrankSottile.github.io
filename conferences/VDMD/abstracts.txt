  150 Years of Coloring Graphs on Surfaces: A Drama in Several Acts

   Michael O. Albertson, Smith    College         

 Determining the chromatic number of a graph is 
notoriously difficult.  Assuming that the graph is
embedded on a surface doesn't help much.  Supplying best
possible bounds, The Map Color Theorem and the Four Color
Theorem were Graph Theory's first complete success.  We begin
with a highlights tour of these classic results.  Next we look at
the recently finished story of coloring embedded graphs that look
planar.  We include a proof sketch of the best possible result that
locally
planar graphs can be 5-colored.  We conclude
with a few open questions and speculate on future developments.

Techniques for Proving Lower Bounds on Graph Separation Width

 Arny Rosenberg, U Mass

 An M-separator of an N-node graph G is a set of edges whose removal
partitions G into subgraphs having M and N-M nodes, respectively.
While many provably or experientially good techniques are known for
finding small M-separators for broad classes of graphs, rather few
broadly applicable techniques are known for establishing lower bounds
on the sizes of such separators.  In this talk we describe and
contrast two broadly applicable techniques for establishing lower
bounds on the M-separation-width of an N-node graph, which is the size
of the graph's smallest M-separator.

The material for this talk is extracted from my new book, coauthored
with Lenny Heath, entitled "Graph Separators, with Applications"
(Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishing).

Folding Carpenter's Rules, Robot Arms, Proteins: a Combinatorial
Approach

Ileana Streinu, Smith College


Robot arms can be modeled as simple polygonal chains with rigid bars and
rotating joints. Planning non-colliding motions between two configurations
of a robot arm is a notoriously hard problem, for which the currently
known best algorithms run in exponential time. An efficient solution in
dimension 3 could have an impact in understanding apparently unrelated
questions, such as how proteins fold.

In this talk I will present a suprisingly simple combinatorial solution to
the 2-dimensional version. The Carpenter's Rule Problem, "Can every planar
polygonal chain be convexified with non-colliding planar motions?" was
open since the '70. It was answered in the affirmative in the early 2000,
and my contribution - the subject of this talk - was to give an efficient
algorithmic solution. I will present it with a lot of graphical props:
animations, games, even some 3d-graphics. Along the way, we'll use tools
ranging from a 19th century theorem of J. Clerk Maxwell to graph
embeddings, oriented matroids, combinatorial rigidity theory and
visibility computations in Computational Geometry.

Sperner's theorem and its generalizations

Matthias Beck, Suny Binghamton

Abstract: We study the set $P(S)$ consisting of all subsets of a finite
set $S$, partially ordered by subset inclusion. A chain is a linearly
ordered subset of $P(S)$. In 1928, Sperner found a bound (in terms of the
size of $S$) for the size of an antichain, that is, a subset of $P(S)$ in
which there are no nontrivial chains.

His result was generalized in three different directions: by Erd\H{o}s to
subsets of $P(S)$ in which chains contain at most $r$ elements; by
Meshalkin to certain classes of compositions of $S$; by Griggs, Stahl, and
Trotter through replacing the antichains by certain sets of pairs of
disjoint elements of $P(S)$. We unify Erd\H{o}s's, Meshalkin's, and
Griggs-Stahl-Trotter's inequalities with a common generalization. We
similarly unify their accompanying LYM inequalities. Our bounds do not in
general appear to be the best possible.

One of our proofs extends to analogous statements--with a twist--about
flats in a projective geometry.

This is joint work with Xueqin Wang and Thomas Zaslavsky.

Combinatorics of resonances

Dmitry Kozlov,  KTH  

I shall outline some connections between the topology
of spaces of polynomials with roots of fixed multiplicities and
combinatorics.

More specifically, I will advertise the use of a certain new
combinatorial object. This object is a category, which
I call resonance category. It reflects the combinatorial
structures arising in the canonical stratifications of
the symmetric smash products. I will then use the current
knowledge of the combinatorial structure of this category
to perform explicit computations for various spaces of
real hyperbolic polynomials with restrictions on 
the multiplicities of roots.

A Root System Description of Pattern Avoidance 
       with Applications to $G/B$ 

Sara Billey, MIT

Pattern avoidance has been used to classify several notions
for permutations and signed permutations.  In this talk, we propose a
new generalization of  pattern avoidance which can be applied to
all root systems and their Weyl groups.  The main theorem shows that
for any semisimple Lie group $G$ and maximal Borel subgroup $B$,
smooth Schubert varieties in $G/B$ can be characterized by this new
method with a very short list of patterns.

This is joint work with A. Postnikov.
