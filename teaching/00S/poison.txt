Write up for Poison due 8 February

    Write up should include
    * Detailed solution to the problem 
        - winning strategy for any number of counters

    The length should be reasonable, around 3-5 pages.  
    2.1 pages double spaced is likely insufficient, while
    6 pages with no spacing is far to long.

    1) State the problem (Clearly describe how the game is played, and the
                goal of the activity)
    2) Describe the strategies you used to attack the problem
    3) Describe the solution you obtained, and why it is complete.
        It can help to describe solution for 10, then for other numbers.
       A summary may be a good thing.
    4) Make some concluding remarks, what did you learn from this example

     Communication is the key.  It is surprisingly difficult to 
      make yourself understood in writing.
     To that end, I ask that you have a friend (not in this class) certify
      that they read and understood your write up

     I will grade on spelling, grammar, creativity, 
       and general quality of writing.
