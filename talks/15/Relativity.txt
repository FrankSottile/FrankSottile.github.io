Special Relativity

Frank Sottile

    Einstein's theory of special relativity, like much of
theoretical physics, may be understood to follow from simple
principles through deductive reasoning.  In today's circle,
we will discuss this theory, using mathematics to deduce 
its main geometric consequences, following one of Einstein's
treatments of the theory.
