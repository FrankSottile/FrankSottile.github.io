      University of North Carolina.</b>
 <p>
 We present a geometric proof of the Horn Conjecture and obtain the
 Saturation conjecture for <i>Gl</I>(<i>n</i>) as a consequence. 
 The Horn conjecture says
 that non vanishing of Littlewood-Richardson numbers 
 <i>c<sup>l</sup><sub>m,n</sub></i> is
 equivalent to the semi-stability of a certain <I>N</I>-filtered vector space (for
 generic flags). Knutson-Tao gave combinatorial proofs of the Saturation
 conjecture using the theory of Honeycombs. Fulton showed that Saturation implies
 the Horn Conjecture. Our proof here is independent of these previous works and
 raises interesting questions on the Quantum analogues of the Horn Conjecture.

 <p> 
 Soergel has recently shown that knowledge of torsion in the intersection
 cohomology of Schubert varieties leads to information about modular
 representation theory. In particular, he has asked what is the smallest 
 <I>N</I> > 0 for which the decomposition theorem holds with coefficients in
 <b>Z</b>[1/<i>N</I>] for a given Bott-Samelson resolution 
 <I>X</I> --> <i>X<sub>w</sub></i> of a Schubert variety <i>X<sub>w</sub></i>. 
 This implies that there is no 
 <b>Z</b>/<i>p</i><b>Z</b>-torsion in the intersection cohomology stalks of 
 <i>X<sub>w</sub></i> for <i>p</I>|<i>N</I>.

 We describe certain polynomials representing a basis for the equivariant
 cohomology H<sup>*</sup><SUB><i>T</I></sub>(<i>X</i>) which can be used 
 to calculate <i>N</I>. 
 We present examples in types <i>A</i><sub>7</sub> and 
 <i>D</i><sub>4</sub> for which <i>N</i> > 1.

 Universal Schubert polynomials, which give the answer to

 <A HREF="http://math.gmu.edu/~rgoldin">Rebecca Goldin</A>, 
  George Mason University.</b>
 <p>  
We reframe the question of equivariant Schubert calculus of complete
flag varieties in terms of Bott-Samelson manifolds, desingularizations
of the flag varieties. In particular, there is a more general algebra
related to the equivariant cohomology ring of a Bott-Samelson sitting
over a Schubert variety, and we show how to multiply in this algebra.
One result is a non-positive formula (and geometric interpretation
thereof) for Schubert calculus. The same formula was discovered
combinatorially by Sara Billey. Although this is not a positive
calculus, there are restricted cases in which it gives a positive
formula. Perhaps more interestingly, it sheds light on some geometry
behind Schubert calculus. The work we present is joint with Allen
Knutson. Some of it was independently discovered by Mathieu Willems
(and can be found on the math archives).

 <p> 
 The action of a complex torus on a non-singular projective
 variety is a GKM action if there are finitely many fixed points and
 finitely many one-dimensional orbits. For such an action the fixed points
 and one-dimensional orbits can be viewed as the vertices and edges of a
 regular graph, and Goresky, Kottwitz and MacPherson showed that the
 equivariant cohomology ring of the space can be read off from this graph.
 In this talk we show that an analogous result is true for "GKM spaces
 with non-isolated fixed points". The work I will report on is joint with
 Tara Holm.

 <A HREF=""></A>Harald Hengelbrock, Universit&auml;t Bochum.</b>
 <p> 
  Quantum Schubert calculus exhibits a number of symmetries which lead to 
  equalities of certain Gromov Witten invariants, mainly a 
  <B>Z</B>/<i>n</I> action and 
  an involution related to complex conjugation. We analyze the structure 
  of these symmetries and give applications to quantum Schubert calculus.

 </b>
 <p>
We derive a recurrence on Schubert structure constants from the
noncomplex Weyl group action on <I>G</I>/<i>B</i>. 
It is occasionally positive;
for example it computes
<CENTER>
 <i>c</I><SUB>532164,132546</SUB><SUP>642153</SUP>
  &nbsp; =  &nbsp; 0+0+0+0+1+0+0+0+0+1+0+0+0 &nbsp; =  &nbsp; 2.
</CENTER>
The main tool is equivariant cohomology, but the formula doesn't
require any division by polynomials, so works fine in ordinary
cohomology. The formula includes, or rather it's partly based on,
descent-cycling.

 <p>
 We construct a flat degeneration of the flag manifold to the
toric variety <i>Y</I> associated to the Gel'fand-Cetlin polytope. Every
Schubert variety <I>X<SUB>w</SUB></I> degenerates to a reduced union of toric
subvarieties of <i>Y</I>, generalizing results of Gonciulea and Lakshmibai. The

Fomin-Kirillov. This is joint work with Ezra Miller.

 <A HREF="http://math.albany.edu:8000/math/pers/lenart/">Cristian Lenart</A>, SUNY Albany. </b>
 <p>
We present some explicit multiplication formulas in the Grothendieck
ring of the variety of complete flags in <B>C</B><SUP><i>n</i></sup>, which
generalize some well-known formulas in cohomology. Our formulas involve
Grothendieck polynomials, which are representatives for Schubert classes
in the Grothendieck ring. These formulas are concerned with: (1) the
hyperplane section of a Schubert variety (a Monk type formula); (2) the
restriction of a dominant line bundle to a Schubert variety; (3) the
multiplication of an arbitrary Schubert class by a special one, which is
pulled back from a Grassmannian projection (a Pieri type formula). We
show the way in which formulas (1) and (2) are related by convolution
inverse in a certain Hopf algebra. Different and more general formulas
for (1) and (2) were given by A. Ram, H. Pittie, and M. Brion. Their
formulas are in terms of Littelmann paths, and are only shown to hold in
the Grothendieck ring. Our formulas are polynomial identities, and are
in terms of chains in the Bruhat order on the symmetric group. The
latter framework seems more suitable for multiplication problems in
Schubert calculus, as shown by previous work in this area. The part of
this work related to problem (3) is joint with F. Sottile.

 <p>    
A theorem of Kim gives a presentation of the (small)
quantum cohomology ring of the generalized flag manifold
<I>G</I>/<I>B</I>. In order to have a complete picture of this
ring, one needs a solution to the "quantum Giambelli
problem", i.e. polynomial representatives of Schubert
classes in Kim's ring. We present a general formula
for such polynomials, which involves representatives
of Schubert classes in Borel's description of 
<I>H</I><SUP>*</SUP>(<I>G</I>/<I>B</I>),
divided difference operators and the coefficients of the
"quantum Chevalley formula".

 <b><font color="FF00FF">Positivity of quiver cycles via deformation.</font></br>
 <A href="www-math.mit.edu/~ezra">Ezra Miller</A>, MSRI &amp; U. Minnesota.</b>
 <p>
Fix vector spaces <i>V</I><SUB>0</SUB>, ..., <i>V<SUB>n</SUB></I>,
and consider the set Hom(<i>V</I>) of quivers 
<i>V</I><SUB>0</SUB> --> ... --> <i>V<SUB>n</SUB></I>.
Quiver cycles are subsets 
<i>O<SUB>r</SUB></I> of Hom(<i>V</I>) where the ranks of
the composite maps <i>V<SUB>i</SUB></I> --> <i>V<SUB>j</SUB></I> 
are bounded above by specified integers
<i>r</I> = <i>r<SUB>ij</SUB></i> for <i>i</I> < <i>j</I>. 
Buch and Fulton expressed the equivariant
cohomology class [<i>O<SUB>r</SUB></I>] in terms of Schur functions, 
and conjectured a
combinatorial formula for the coefficients. In particular, they
conjectured that the coefficients, which directly generalize
Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, are positive.

In this ongoing project, we construct a flat family whose general fiber
is isomorphic to <i>O<SUB>r</SUB></I>, and whose special fiber 
has components that are
products of matrix Schubert varieties. 
This proves a formula for [<i>O<SUB>r</SUB></I>]
in terms of Stanley symmetric functions (stable double Schubert
polynomials) 
<i>F<SUB>w</SUB></I> indexed by lists <i>w</I> of <i>n</I> permutations. Our
formula is obviously positive for geometric reasons, so it immediately
implies positivity of the Buch-Fulton formula. Moreover, we conjecture
that the special fiber is generically reduced, so that our coefficients
all equal&nbsp;1, and we propose a simple nonrecursive combinatorial
characterization of which lists <i>w</I> appear.
This is joint work with Allen Knutson and Mark Shimozono.

 <p>
The quantum Bruhat graph, which is an extension of the graph formed by covering 
relations in the Bruhat order, is naturally related to the quantum 
cohomology ring of <i>G</I>/<i>B</I>. We enhance a result of Fulton and Woodward 
by showing that the minimal monomial in the quantum parameters that occurs in
the quantum product of two Schubert classes has a simple interpretation in terms 
of directed paths in this graph.
<p>
We define path Schubert polynomials, which are quantum cohomology analogues 
of skew Schubert polynomials recently introduced by Lenart and Sottile.
They are given by sums over paths in the quantum Bruhat graph of type A. 
The 3-point Gromov-Witten invariants for the flag manifold are expressed 
in terms of these polynomials. This construction gives a combinatorial 
description for the set of all monomials in the quantum parameters that 
occur in the quantum product of two Schubert classes.

 <p>

For any complex semisimple lie group <i>G</I>, we know that in the ordinary 
cohomology ring <I>H</I><SUP>*</SUP>(<i>G</I>/<i>B</I>; <b>Z</b>), many of 
the structure constants (for the Schubert basis) vanish, and the rest are 
strictly positive. 
 We present a combinatorial game which provides some criteria for determining 
which of these Schubert structure constants vanish. 
Although these criteria are not proven to cover all cases, in practice 
they work very well, giving a complete answer to the question for 
<i>G</I> = GL(7,<b>C</b>).

 The Peterson variety is a projective variety
introduced by Dale Peterson that encodes the quantum cohomology
rings of all partial flag varieties as coordinate rings coming
from an affine paving. We will describe its `positive part'
(in the sense of total positivity for matrices). This is
related to Schubert bases and the positivity of structure
constants in quantum Schubert calculus.

 <p>
In the lecture we approach the theory of Schur and Schubert
polynomials from the point of view of generalized Thom polynomials,
i.e. we realize these polynomials as equivariant Poincare duals of
orbits of some representation. Then we can apply the author's method
to compute them as Thom polynomials, thus we get new definitions for
Schur and Schubert polynomials. Interestingly enough we will obtain
them as unique solutions of linear equation systems. Other definitions
for Schur and Schubert polynomials (e.g. the Lascoux-Sch&uuml;tzenberger
recursion) will be interpreted in this language. Along the way we also
redefine the double Schubert polynomials and define "double Schur
polynomials". We show how this approach is related to the structure
of the cohomology ring of the Grassmannian, the flag manifold and
other quotient spaces.

algebraic geometry and can be applied to study the small quantum

 <p>
In the GKM picture of the equivariant cohomology of flag varieties, a
Schubert class <I>S<SUB>w</sub></I> is regarded as a map (satisfying some compatibility
conditions) that attaches a polynomial to each fixed point. The equivariant
Schubert class <I>S<SUB>w</sub></I> can be computed by applying a left divided difference
operator (associated to a certain reduced word) to the top class, and the
value <I>S<SUB>w</sub></I>(<i>u</I>) is obtained by adding the (rational) 
contributions of certain
subwords. For Grassmannians, these subwords correspond bijectively to fixed
points for a torus action on a smooth manifold, and the computation of
<I>S<SUB>w</sub></I>(<i>u</I>) is equivalent to integrating an equivariant 
form over this manifold.
