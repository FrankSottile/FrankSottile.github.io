<H2>5.iii. Recent developments</H2>

<P>
 Since this was written, we have found
 further evidence in support of these conjectures of Shapiro and Shapiro,
 and also more examples of enumerative
 problems are known that may have all their solutions real.
 In&nbsp;[<A HREF="Bib.html#So99">So99</A>],
 we show there is a choice of real numbers 
 <I>s<SUB>1</SUB>, s<SUB>2</SUB>, ..., s<SUB>mp</SUB></I> in
 <A HREF="SectII.2.html">Conjecture 1</A> for which all 
 <I>d<SUB>m,p</SUB></I>  <I>p</I>-planes are
 real.
 More generally, the main result 
 of&nbsp;[<A  HREF="Bib.html#So99">So99</A>]
 is that for Pieri Schubert  data in 
 <A HREF="SectIII.2.html">Conjecture&nbsp;2</A>, there is a choice of
 real numbers 
 <I>s<SUB>1</SUB>, s<SUB>2</SUB>, ..., s<SUB>n</SUB></I> for which all 
 <I>p</I>-planes are real.

<P>
 We have also answered <A HREF="SectV.2.html">Question 1</A> concerning flag
 varieties affirmatively for hypersurface Schubert conditions.
 These are all Grassmanian Schubert data, where each condition comes from a
 hypersurface Schubert condition on a
 Grassmannian&nbsp;[<A HREF="Bib.html#So99c">So00b</A>].
 This leads to a conjectural anser to  <A HREF="SectV.2.html">Question 2</A>
 for Grassmannian Schubert data involving non-crossing partitions
 (Manuscript and calcultions in preparation.)
 Similarly, a large class of enumerative problems arising in the quantum
 cohomology of flag manifolds (and related to systems theory) may have
 all their solutions be real&nbsp;[<A HREF="Bib.html#So99b">So00a</A>].
 The method of proof in these cases is related to the the homotopy
 continuation  algorithms of&nbsp;[<A HREF="Bib.html#HSS">HSS</A>].
 In a related development, Dietmaier has shown that all 40 positions of the
 Stewart platform in robotics may be real&nbsp;[<A HREF="Bib.html">D</A>]. 

<P>
 A consequence of&nbsp;[<A  HREF="Bib.html#So99">So99</A>]
 is that <A HREF="SectIII.2.html">Conjecture&nbsp;2</A> would follow from 
 an affirmative answer to <A  HREF="SectV.2.html#">Question 4</A>, namely
 that the systems which arise in these conjectures are <I>always</I>
 non-degenerate. 
 While all this bolsters our conviction that these conjectures of Shapiro
 and Shapiro are true, the conjecture is still very much open.
 All of these results, and the evidence for these conjectures of Shapiro and
 Shapiro presented here, do show that there should be a broader theory
 of real enumerative geometry to explain these phenomena.
<P>
Very recently, A.&nbsp;Gabrielov and A.&nbsp;Eremenko gave a proof of
Conjectures&nbsp;<A HREF="SectII.2.html">1</A> and 
<A HREF="SectIII.2.html">2</A>
for Grassmannians of 2-dimensioinal
subspaces of a vector space [<a href="http:Bib.html#EG">EG</a>].
