Lecture Day 1 (Outline)

* Pass out information sheet (Printout of WWW page)

    - Discuss near-term schedule; only expected missed
      lectures.

* Pass around 3x5 cards   - Name
                          - Background
                          - Contact  (email/phone)
                          - Computer Acess
                          - What hope to learn from class

* Talk about course
   - Purpose is to introduce algebraic geometry via some
     examples of applications; will teach some systems theory.
     Frank is expert in algebraic geometry, not systems theory.
   - Handouts from the drafts of the book.  Feedback is welcome,
     particularly negative comments.

* Have a round the class introductions, after the 3x5 cards.
   Take notes on them. 

* Begin Lecture
   - State-Space form of a linear system.
      proper & strictly proper linear systems
      McMillan degree
   - Controllable, observable, & minimal realizations
   - Output Feedback. 
       Response measured by autonomous system
