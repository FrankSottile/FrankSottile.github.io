<b>Abstract:</b><br>
  Work of Klyachko and of Knutson and Tao proved Horn's recursion for non-zero
  Littlewood-Richardson coefficients:  A Littlewood-Richardson coefficient is non-zero if
  and only if it satisfies linear inequalities imposed by smaller Littlewood
  Richardson coefficients.
  Belkale gave a proof of this recursion using geometry.

  In this talk, I will discuss similar recursions for the analog of the
  Littlewood-Richardson coefficients for Schur <I>P</I>- and <I>Q</I>- functions, obtained by
  generalizing Belkale's work.
  While the coefficients for each type differ only by a (known) power of
  2, the geometry of cominuscule flag manifolds gives two different
  recursions, one for each type.
