<P>
A <I>combinatorial Hopf algebra</I> is a graded connected Hopf algebra <I>H</I>
 over a field <b>k</b> equipped with a character (multiplicative linear
 functional) \zeta : <I>H</I> -->  <b>b</b>.
 We show that the terminal object in the category of combinatorial Hopf
 algebras is the algebra QSym of quasi-symmetric functions; this explains the
 ubiquity  of quasi-symmetric functions as generating  functions in
 combinatorics. 
 We illustrate this with several examples.
 We prove that every character decomposes uniquely as a product of an <I>even</I>
 character and an <I>odd</I> character. 
 Correspondingly, every combinatorial Hopf algebra (<I>H</I>, \zeta) possesses
 two canonical Hopf subalgebras on which the character \zeta is even
 (respectively, odd). 
 The odd subalgebra is defined by certain canonical relations which we call the
 generalized Dehn-Sommerville relations.  
 We show that the generalized Dehn-Sommerville relations for \QSym are the
 Bayer-Billera relations and the odd subalgebra  is the peak Hopf algebra of
 Stembridge. 
 We prove that QSym is the product (in the categorical sense) of its even and
 odd Hopf subalgebras. 
 We also calculate the odd subalgebras of various  related combinatorial Hopf
 algebras:  the Malvenuto-Reutenauer Hopf algebra of  permutations,  the
 Loday-Ronco Hopf algebra of planar binary trees, the Hopf algebras of symmetric
 functions and of non-commutative symmetric functions.
