Directory listing of 9flexes.maple

These files were used to draw the maximally inflected quintics with 9 flexes
viewed at ../9flexes.html. The most important file is the precomputed
parameterizations of the curves. We used a combination of Maple and Singular
to compute them, and also the data concerning the double points.

The remaining files draw the curves, with main.maple drawing all of them in
a not very pretty format (Grab it and data, and run it through your local
version of maple), while the rest display the curves. The numbering 01---41
reflects the order in which the solutions were generated, and not how they
are displated on ../9flexes.html.
