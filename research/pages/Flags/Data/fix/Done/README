These are the files to run instances of the enumerative problem.

1)  Put these into a directory with a datafile, named  "data.initial"
     This may already have happened

2)  type "maple ../MapleFiles/initial.maple"

(The next two are often not necessary,and you can just skip to 5

  3)  type "./test.sh"  to run 10 instances for timing purposes
                       --- Fewer for a big problem

            Look into data for the timing, and decide how many instances are
            feasuble for computing.  Edit run.sh accordingly

  4) Repeat #2
)
    
5)  type  "nohup ./run.sh &"

Wait for the output, which will get mailed to all of us.

Also, check on the computation periodically.
