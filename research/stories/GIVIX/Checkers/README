This directory contains source code and computations 
using the python implementation of Vakil's algorithm
to study Schubert Galois groups on all small Grassmannians.

G49_output/      This subdirectory contains the output from running an early
                   version on G(4,9).   These data are the input for most of
                   the computations and classifications in the paper 
                   "Classification of Schubert Galois groups in the Grassmannian G(4,9)"
 
Tests_G2n.txt    The output from testing G(2,n) for n=13,14,15,16,17 (test_G2n.sh)
Tests_G3n.txt    The output from testing G(3,n) for n=11,12  (test_G3n.sh)
Tests_py.txt     The output for Table 1, from running test_Grassmannians.sh
readme.md        Brief readme file about the software, from its github page
CheckerGame.txt  File describing some of the internal storage of Schubert problems in the python code
src/             Directory with all the source python code (some of it compiled for a 
                   Linux system)
test_G2n.sh      These are bash shell script wrapping the calling of the python code
test_G3n.sh        for some Grassmannians
