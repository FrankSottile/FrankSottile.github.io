<font color=maroon><h3>Week 3: 30 January 2024. </h3></font>
<ul>
  <li><font color=maroon><B>Opening Remarks:</b></font><br>

    <font color=magenta>I am still waiting to hear directly from <b>five</b> of the seven groups.  One member from each of those groups
    should send me an email message letting me know who are the members of their group.</font>

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These deal with the Greek's forays into number theory and their treatment of infinity.
  It is interesting to note that some of this work that they were fascinated with turned out to be duds (perfect numbers, while cute, are
  not particularly 
  important), while polygonal numbers are simply not important or interesting (except for squares). 
  On the other hand, Euclid's algorithm not only finds the gcd of two integers (and is the foundation for elementary number theory), it also
  finds the gcd of two univariate polynomials.
  Euclid's algorithm appears in modern algebra in the guise of Euclidean rings (this is a topic in the graduate algebra course I teach).
  It is also one of the bases for the very modern theory of <font color=blue><i>Gr&ouml;bner bases</i></font>, which has led to a
  computational revolution in algebra in the past 50 years.
  Euclid's use of the Euclidean algorithm to give foundations for the theory of factorizations of integers, and then to use that to prove
  that there are infinitely many prime numbers  is an example of how mathematical results build on each other.
  I really appreciated Stillwell's discussion connecting the Euclidean Algorithm to constructive solutions of Pell's equation for <i>N</i>=2.
    As he notes, we will see more of this when we look at mathematics from the  Indian subcontinent.
    <!--, but it arises again in the theory of
  elliptic functions that we will try to appreciate closer to the end of this course.--> <br>

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is useful to read and re-read the second page of Section 4.1 in which mentions the Greek method to show that a
  particular number (e.g. limit of a sequence) could not have anything <i>but</i> a particular value &alpha;.
  This is their method of exhaustion.
  This indirect, but completely rigorous, method was used by Archimedes in his famous proof that &pi;=&pi; where &pi; on the left is defined
  to be the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter, and the one on the right, that of the area of a circle to the square of
  its radius. 
  The Greeks knew that these ratios were constants, but it was Archumedes who showed that they are the same constant.
  (He was able to relate at least two other ratios involving surface area and volumes of spheres, showing that they too are equal to &pi;.)
    Keep this in mind when we encounter The Calculus  (particularly the meaning of its Latin root).<br>

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I will be asking you to use exhaustion to prove a result about logarithms (via their definition as the value of a
  particular integral).

     <li>
        Chapters 3 and 4 of Stillwell.

 <li><font color=maroon><b>Assignment:</b> Due Monday, February 5.</font> (HW 3)
  <font color=red>It is OK to discuss this among yourselves.  We all have something to learn from each other.</font><br>
   Here is a <a href="../HW/HW03.pdf">.pdf</a> and a  <a href="../HW/HW03.tex">LaTeX source</a> of the assignment, and 
   the same <a href="../HW/Group03.pdf">.pdf</a> and a  <a href="../HW/Group03.tex">LaTeX source</a> of the group assignment.<br>
   The quiz (on Gradescope) is three exceptionally short questions with even shorter answers that you need to take after you have
  completed the reading.<br>
  <b><font color=maroon>Do not hand in (this is for your group to discuss):</font></b>  
  <ol>
    <li> Please do Stillwell's exercise 3.3.1, about the factors of a number of the form 2<sup><i>n</i>-1</sup><i>p</i>, where <i>p</i> is a
	  prime.
    </li>
    <li>
     I've always been a fan of perfect numbers.
     Give the defining property of a perfect number.
     Prove that if 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>-1 is a prime number,  <i>p</i>, then 2<sup><i>n</i>-1</sup><i>p</i> is a perfect number.
     Write down four perfect numbers.
     How many perfect numbers are there currently known?  
    </li>
    <li>Let us call a positive number <font color=blue><it>ample</it></font> if the sum of its divisors exceeds the number itself.
  For example, 1+2+3+4+6=16&gt;12, so twelve is an ample number.<br>

  Show that any number of the form  2<sup><i>n</i>-1</sup>(2<sup><i>n</i></sup>-1) is either perfect or ample.<br>
  
  Give an ample number not of this form.

     </li>
  </ol>
   <b><font color=maroon>To hand in:</font></b>  <font color=red>We are using Gradescope for homework submission</font>.
   <ol>
     <li> Stillwell gives Euclid&apos;s elegant proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers, one of the great proofs in mathematics.
  Find and describe/explain a <i>different</i> proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers.

   <li>
     Continued fractions are somewhat of a lost art.
     It is known, for example, that the truncations of a continued fraction for a real number &alpha; are the best rational approximations
     to &alpha;. 
     Do all four exercises in Section 3.4 of Stillwell (3.4.1, 3.4.2, 3.4.3, and 3.4.4).  I also give you one computational question about a
     particular comtinued fraction on the homework.
    </li>
    <li> Please compute the value of the infinite continued fraction with only 1&apos;s in it (see the .pdf for the precise statement).
    </li>
    <li>
       Consider Archimedes&apos; quote from <i>The Method</i>: "It is of course easier to supply the proof when we have previously acquired some
       knowledge of the questions by the method, than it is to find it without any previous knowledge."
       What was "the method" he is referring to?
       What does his quote say about the role of experimentation or studying examples in Mathematics?
    </li>
    <li>
      Archimedes&apos; use of exhaustion to determine areas predated the Calculus by over 1800 years.
      Try your hand at this method by doing the exercises in Stillwell&apos;s Section 4.4 (4.4.1, 4.4.2, and 4.4.3) to prove the
      formula for the logarithm of product <i>of rational numbers</i>.
    Make sure to use exhaustion and not calculus tricks.
    Why did I restrict to your showing the formula for rational numbers?

    <br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; <font color=3300AA>This is challenging.  Do discuss it on Piazza.  Let me provide you with a strong hint.
    Suppose that you want to prove that a particular region <i>R</i> has particular number <i>A</i> as its area.
    For this, you consider lower- and upper- approximations of the area of <i>R</i>.
    In this case, you use rectangles (Riemann sums) to get the lower and upper approximations.<br>

    Now here is where the logic of the method of exhaustion comes in.
    You show that for any number <i>L</i> less than <i>A</i>, there is a lower approximation whose rectangles&apos; areas add up to a number
    exceeding 
    <i>L</i>, and the same, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, for any number <i>G</i> greater than <i>A</i>.
    This shows that the area of <i>R</i> is <i>A</i>, and it is not by an infinitary process.<br>

    I like to think of this method in the following way:
    To show a number (e.g. the area of <i>R</i>) is some area <i>A</i>, is to show that it cannot be less than <i>A</i> and that it cannot
    be greater than <i>A</i>.<br>
    
    Contrast this to the Calculus, where you have Riemann sums that are not necessarily lower or upper approximations to the
    region <i>R</i>, but we have that the values of the Riemann sums converge to some number.
    In (this modern vierw of The Calculus), we do not need to know <i>A</i>, we find <i>A</i> in taking the integral, using Newton&apos;s
    Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.<br>

    What makes The Calculus better&mdash;and this is what I teach, particularly in Calculus 3&mdash;is that by approximating some quantity
    (say flux across a membrane, or surfaces area, or aggregrate gravitational attraction, or ....) by Riemann sums which converge <i>to
    some value</i>, we have not only given a way to calculate the quantity we want, but, and this is important, actually defined that
    quantity.<br> 

    Think about this.  What is the length of a curve that is not made up of arcs of circles or line segments?
    Calculus gives the reasonable and rigorous definition that the length is the limit of lengths of approximating polygons (collections of
    line segments) or arcs of circles. 
    The same is true for other quantities in Science.    
</font><br>




Back to the question you were asked.
From the definition of exhaustion, to show two things are equal, say log(<i>a</i>) and
log(<i>ab</i>)-log(<i>b</i>), is to show how any lower approximation to one can be
transformed into a lower approximation for the other, with the same area, and the same for
upper approximations.  (Note that, as a mathematician, I use log for the logarithm with
respect to the natural base, Euler's number <i>e</i>.)


    </li>
  </ol>
 </li>
  
</ul>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The three parts of the exercises 4.4.1, 4.4.2, and 4.4.3 do blend together.  They are intended to break things up into smaller steps, each
of which is more straightforward. The figure shows an outer approximation of the "area" under $$\frac{1}{x}$$ from $$1$$ to $$a$$ by $$n$$
rectangles that strictly contain the area.  In the same approximation by $$n$$ rectangles of the area under $$\frac{1}{x}$$ from $$b$$ to
$$ab$$, you should see that the corresponding rectangles have the same size.  This is also true for the inner approximation (actually, one
uses left endpoints and the other right endpoints).


In integral calculus, you use such a transformation to show that the two Riemann sums are the same, and then invoke convergence.  This is an
argument that is either taught in undergraduate calculus (at least when I was a student, or when I taught in Toronto), but is also covered
in an analysis course.  It is not as hard as establishing that integrals have the properties that they do, as establishing the correctness
of Riemann integration for monotone functions is nearly trivial.


For exhaustion, each area is the unique number that is smaller than every outer approximation and larger than every inner approximation.
These two sets of approximations being the same for both areas implies that the two areas are equal.


Now it is all downhill for the last problem, the area under $$\frac{1}{x}$$ from $$1$$ to $$ab$$ is the sum of the areas under
$$\frac{1}{x}$$ from $$1$$ to $$b$$ and from $$b$$ to $$ab$$, and then invoke the previous result.


I suggested that this may need some Piazza discussion; probably starting on it earlier would have led to a richer "back and forth".  This
defining a group law by an operation on integrals will recur in this book, and I will assign those problems, for they are extremely
significant historically for mathematics.  For this problem, do try to understand this reasoning, and especially the proof by exhaustion.
It is a rigorous method, sometimes a bit tedious, but it sufficed for a long time for proving such formulas.  You can see its main
limitation in this problem: Why does this shape have an area?  The Theory of Riemann integrals, and later Lesbegue integration give proofs
that these integrals do exist, and therefore that quantities such as area (or electrical flux or net gravitational attraction) are
well-defined.  On top of that, they give often important formulas and methods of calculation.
