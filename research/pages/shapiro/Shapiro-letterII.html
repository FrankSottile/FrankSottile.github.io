<P>
... I was  interested in the cases when
intersection of ANY arrangement of Schubert cells has the M-property. You
are interested in the cases when there EXISTS some open set of arrangements
of real  Schubert cells which intersects in all real points.
I want to adjust my conjecture to your case.

<P>
 Let S<SUB>1</SUB>,..., S<SUB><I>k</I></SUB> be some arrangement of real
 Schubert cells such that 
S<SUB>1</SUB>\cap...\cap S<SUB><I>k</I></SUB> is 0-dimensional and consists
 of the necessary number of points (counted with multiplicities).

<P>
Conjecture. Intersection of any SUBSET of the above cells has the
M-property, i.e. the  sum of Betti numbers is the same as for the
complexified arrangement.

<P>
If your question is open for arrangements of Schubert cells in the space of
complete flags let me know. I may have a wild guess how one constructs such
arrangements (but this is only a wild guess at the moment). <BR><BR>
