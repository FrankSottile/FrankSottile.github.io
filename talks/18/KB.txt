A homotopy algorithm from Khovanskii bases 

Khovanskii bases are an algorithmic tool arising from the
theory of Newton-Okounkov bodies, which associates a
convex body to a linear space L of functions on a variety.
Not every space L of functions has a Khovanskii basis, but
when it does, the Khovanskii basis allows common symbolic
algorithms on the section ring of L.  Also in this case,
the Newton-Okounkov body is a rational polytope, and a flat 
degeneration to a toric variety, which gives a numerical 
homotopy that can compute all solutions to systems of 
equations coming from L.   My talk, which is joint work with 
Elise Walker and Michael Burr, will explain these terms,
and sketch the homotopy algorithm.
