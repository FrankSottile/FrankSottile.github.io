<H2>Real Rational Curves in Grassmannians</H2>

<P>
Fulton asked how many solutions to a problem of enumerative
geometry can be real, when that problem is one of counting geometric figures
of some kind having specified position with respect to some general fixed
figures.
For the problem of plane conics tangent to five general conics, the
(surprising) answer is that all 3264 may be real. 
Similarly, given any problem of enumerating <I>p</I>-planes incident on
some general fixed subspaces, there are real fixed
subspaces such that each of the (finitely many) incident <I>p</I>-planes are
real. 
We show that the problem of enumerating parameterized rational curves in a
Grassmannian satisfying simple (codimension 1) conditions may have all of
its solutions be real.

<P>
This problem of enumerating rational curves on a Grassmannian arose in at
least two distinct areas of mathematics.
The number of such curves was predicted by the formula of Vafa and
Intriligator from mathematical physics.
It is also the number of complex dynamic compensators which stabilize a
particular linear system, and the enumeration was solved in this
context.  
The question of real solutions also arises in systems theory.
Our proof, while exploiting techniques from systems theory, has no direct
implications for the problem of real dynamic output compensation.
