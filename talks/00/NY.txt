Title: Elementary Transversality in the Schubert Calculus.

Author: Frank  Sottile 


Abstract: 
We give an elementary and characteristic-free proof that general
codimensio n-1 Schubert varieties meet generically transversally in a
Grassmannian and in some r elated varieties. This implies that the
corresponding intersection numbers computed i n the Chow (and quantum
Chow) rings of these varieties are enumerative in all charact
eristics.
