Galois groups of Schubert problems

   Work of Jordan from 1870 showed how Galois theory
can be applied to enumerative geometry.  Hermite earlier
showed that the equivalence of Galois groups with geometric 
monodromy groups, and in 1979 Harris used this to study 
Galois groups of many enumerative problems.   Vakil gave 
a geometric-combinatorial criterion that implies a Galois 
group contains the alternating group.  With Brooks and 
Martin del Campo, we used Vakil's criterion to show that 
all Schubert problems involving lines have at least 
alternating Galois group.  White and I have given a new 
proof of this based on 2-transitivity.

  My talk will describe this background and sketch a 
current project to systematically determine Galois groups 
of all Schubert problems of moderate size on all small 
classical flag manifolds, investigating at least several 
million problems.  This will use supercomputers employing 
several overlapping methods, including combinatorial 
criteria, symbolic computation, and numerical homotopy 
continuation, and require the development of new 
algorithms and software.
