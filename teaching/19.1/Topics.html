  <font size=+2 color=maroon>Here are some topics that students have written about, as well as a number of my
    suggestions.
    I'd really like to see papers related directly to the book, to comparative literature between it and other sources,
    and particularly to mathematics.</font>
<ul>

  <!---   Flatland pecific -->
  <li>A paper on some aspect of the book (this is an overlooked range of topics).</li>
  <li>Weapons and War in Flatland.</li>
  <li>Inconsistencies in the book Flatland.</li>
  <li>Demographics/class distribution of Flatland based on material in the book and population modeling.</li>
  <li>Compare how the characters in Flatland maintain awareness of their surroundings vs.
       how robotic systems maintain recognize their surroundings.</li>
  <li>Distribution of Social Classes in Flatland</li>
  <li>Spac 101 - Spatial Reasoning (A course in a future Flatland univesity)</li>
  <li>A Forethought (extra chapters)</li>
  <li>An epilogue (in the style of Abbott).</li> 
  <li>Temporal Land (an extra chapter)</li>
