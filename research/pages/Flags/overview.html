<P> &nbsp; &nbsp; 
 In 1995 <A HREF="http://www.matematik.su.se/~shapiro">Boris Shapiro</A> and 
 <A HREF="http://www.mth.msu.edu/~mshapiro">Michael Shapiro</A>
 made a remarkable conjecture concerning real solutions 
 to enumerative geometric problems on the Grassmannian. 
 Later, Sottile tested a few instances of these conjecture
 and much to his surprise found it to hold in every case. 
 The apparent validity of this conjecture has inspired a 
 significant amount of <A HREF="shapiro/shapiro.bib.html">research</A>, 
 including a <A HREF="../shapiro/index.html">previous</A> 
 experimental project of Sottile that inspired this current project. 
 While the general conjecture of Shapiro and Shapiro remains open 
 (in 2003), it was established for Grassmannian of 2-planes 
 in <I>n</I>-space by A.&nbsp;Eremenko and 
 A.&nbsp;Gabrielov&nbsp;[<A href="bibliography.html#EG00">EG00</A>].  

<P> &nbsp; &nbsp; 
 The original conjecture of Shapiro and Shapiro dealt not only 
 with Grassmannians, but also with more general flag manifolds. 
 (An <A href="original_conjecture.html">excerpt</A> from an email 
 message of Autumn 1995 from Boris Shapiro to Sottile.) 
 It is false in this wider generality. However, it fails 
 in a very interesting way, and the purpose of this project 
 is to investigate this failure and to make new conjectures  
 concerning the classical manifold of flags in <i>n</I>-space. 
 These new conjectures are generalizations of the Shapiro 
 conjecture forGrassmannians. 

<P> &nbsp; &nbsp; 
 Supporting these new conjectures are  first and foremost  
 massive experimental data. 
 To date, we have used 15.76 GHz-years of 
 computer time to investigate 1126 different 
 enumerative problems on 29 different 
 flag manifolds. 
  In all, we have solved  &nbsp;525&nbsp;420&nbsp;135 polynomial systems; determining  
 the numbers of real and of complex solutions in each. 
 In addition, we are able to prove the conjectures in 
 0 cases by examining discriminants. 
 We also have theoretical results linking different enumerative
 problems, this  proves infinitely many instances of the conjectures,
 by reducing them to cases previously established. 
 In short, we are quite confident of the validity 
 of these conjectures. 

<P> &nbsp; &nbsp; 
 The primary purpose of this document is to 
 <A HREF="Data/index.html">archive</A> our 
 computations and facilitate our data analysis. 
 However, it will also provide context, with a description of 
 the geometry of the flag manifolds and Schubert varieties, 
 statements of the conjectures,  and statements of some 
 theorems we have established concerning them. 
 This document contains analysis of the instances established 
 by examining discriminants, as well as a discussion of
 how the data was taken. 
 All software used in this project is also archived here.
