We define and characterize <I>switching</I>, an operation that takes 
 two Young tableaux sharing a common border, ``moves them through each
other'', and produces another such pair.  This operation clarifies a
connection between algorithms described by Haiman and by James and Kerber.
Haiman's algorithm is a generalization of Sch&uuml;tzenberger's <I> jeu de
taquin</I>, while the algorithm of James and Kerber has been used by White to
prove a generalization of the Littlewood-Richardson rule.  We establish new
results and provide new proofs of results concerning the <I> jeu de
taquin</I>, evacuation, Schur functions, Young tableaux, characters of
representations, branching rules, the Littlewood-Richardson rule, and
symmetries of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients.
