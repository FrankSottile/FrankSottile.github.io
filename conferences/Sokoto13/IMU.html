<h2>For Prof. M.O. Ibrahim only</h2>

<p>
 Dear Professor Ibrahim,<br>

  Today, I worked on material to submit to the International Mathematical Union
to apply for some funding (2,000 Euros) for the school in Sokoto.
Here is a 
<a href="http://www.mathunion.org/cdc/grants/conference-support-program/application-requirements/">description</a>
of their program for conferences in developing countries, and
here is a 
<a href="http://www.mathunion.org/cdc/grants/applications/new-application/apply-for-conference-support/">link
to the application form</A>. 
<br>

I expect to be able to fill it out for you, if that is OK with you.
I have also prepared some text to include in the application.<br>
First, is a <a href="IMU/Letter.txt">cover letter</a> for the application.
<br>
Next, I have a <a href="IMU/Description.txt">description</a> of the school.
<br>
Lastly, I have a discussion of the
<a href="IMU/Budget.txt">Budget</a>, who is also supporting the school, what are the costs and
numbers of participants, and what we would use the IMU money for.
