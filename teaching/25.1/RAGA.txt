Real Algebraic Geometry for Applications. 

   Real algebraic geometry is a fundamental input for many
applications of algebraic geometry.  Its goals and methods 
are also distinct from classical algebraic geometry.  
I expect to cover topics such as real solutions to systems 
of equations, including upper and lower bounds, positivity
and sums of squares, real toric varieties, and non-standard
real structures.

   This is based on parts of my book "Real solutions
to Equations from Geometry", two chapters 
in Theobald's book "Real Algebraic Geometry and Optimization", 
as well as papers and other sources.

Grading is through class attendance and end-of-term presentations.

NOTE:   To sign up for this and for Landsberg's Algebraic Geometry II
      (both MATH 666), you need to write Briana Hague and ask for a waiver.
