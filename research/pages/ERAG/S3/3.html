<H2>The Stewart-Gough platform</H2>
The position of a rigid body in <B>R</B><SUP>3</SUP> has 6 degrees of freedom.
This is exploited in robotics, giving rise to the Stewart-Gough
platform&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="../bibliography.html#Go57">Gou</A>,<A
 HREF="../bibliography.html#St65">Ste</A>].
Specifically, suppose we have 6 fixed points 
<I>A</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>A</I><SUB>2</SUB>, ..., <I>A</I><SUB>6</SUB>
in space and 6 points 
<I>B</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>B</I><SUB>2</SUB>, ..., <I>B</I><SUB>6</SUB>
on a rigid body <I>B</I> (the framework of
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:stewart">5</A>).<A NAME="fig:stewart"></A>

</DIV><P></P>
The body is controlled by varying each distance <I>l<SUB>i</SUB></I> between
the fixed point <I>A<SUB>i</SUB></I> and the point <I>B<SUB>i</SUB></I>.
This may be accomplished by attaching rigid actuators to
spherical joints located at the points <I>B<SUB>i</SUB></I>, or by suspending
the platform from cables.

<P>
Given a position of the body <I>B</I> in space, the distances 
<I>l</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>l</I><SUB>2</SUB>, ..., <I>l</I><SUB>6</SUB>
are uniquely determined.
A fundamental problem is the inverse question:
Given a platform (positions of the <I>A<SUB>i</SUB></I> fixed and the relative
positions between the <I>B<SUB>i</SUB></I> specified) and a sextuple of distances 
<I>l</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>l</I><SUB>2</SUB>, ..., <I>l</I><SUB>6</SUB>, what is
the position of the platform in space?

<P>
It had long been understood that several positions were possible for a given
sextuple of lengths.
An early work in 1897 showed there could be as many as 16 different
positions&nbsp;[<A HREF="../bibliography.html#Br1897">Br</A>]. 
This leads to the following enumerative problem.

<P>
<P>
<DIV><B>Question  3.4</B> &nbsp; 
For a given Stewart platform, how many (complex) positions are there for a
generic choice of the distances 
<I>l</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>l</I><SUB>2</SUB>, ..., <I>l</I><SUB>6</SUB>?
How many of these can be real?</DIV><P></P>

<P>
In the early 1990's, several approaches (numerical
experimentation&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="../bibliography.html#Ra91">Ra</A>], intersection theory&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="../bibliography.html#RV95">RV</A>], Gr&#246;bner
bases&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="../bibliography.html#La93">Laz</A>], resultants&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="../bibliography.html#Mo93">Mo1</A>], and algebra&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="../bibliography.html#Mo94">Mo2</A>]) each
showed that there are 40 complex positions of a general Stewart platform.
The obviously practical question of how many positions could be real 
remained open until 1998, when Dietmaier introduced a novel method to
find a value of the distances
<I>l</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>l</I><SUB>2</SUB>, ..., <I>l</I><SUB>6</SUB>
with all 40 positions real.

<P>
<P>
<DIV><B>Theorem  3.5</B> (Dietmaier&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="../bibliography.html#Di98">Di</A>])  &nbsp; 
All 40  positions can be real.</DIV><P></P>

<P>
Dietmaier's method will find future applications to other problems of this kind.
He began with a formulation of the problem as a system of equations depending
upon the distances 
<I>l</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>l</I><SUB>2</SUB>, ..., <I>l</I><SUB>6</SUB>.
An initial solution for a given instance of the distances
gave 6 real solutions and 17 pairs of complex conjugate solutions.
He then used an ingenious algorithm to vary the distances in search of a
configuration with all 40 solutions real.

<P>
This algorithm systematically varies the distances with the intention of
increasing the number of real solutions.
It proceeds in two stages.
In the first stage, a pair of complex conjugate solutions 
(<I>x</I>, <I>xbar</I>) are
driven together, eventually creating a double solution,
while at the same time the existing real solutions are kept bounded away from
one another.
At the formation of a double (necessarily real) solution, the distances are
further incremented to create two new nearby real solutions 
(<I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB>, <I>x</I><SUB>2</SUB>),
which are then driven apart in the second stage.
This procedure is repeated again with another pair of complex conjugate
solutions, and <I>et cetera</I>.<A NAME="fig:Dietmaier"></A>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:Dietmaier">6</A> illustrates the two stages.

<P></P>

<CAPTION ALIGN="BOTTOM"><STRONG>Figure 6:</STRONG>
The two stages of Dietmaier's algorithm.</CAPTION>
<TR><TD><IMG SRC="Dietmaier.png"></TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV><P></P>

<P>
In each stage, Dietmaier accomplishes the given task (eg.&nbsp;colliding conjugate
solutions) by linearizing the system at the current solutions and then  
solving a linear program for the optimal increment of the distances for
the given goal. 
Changing the distances, he uses Newton's method beginning with the
current solutions to find solutions for the new set of distances, and then
repeats this procedure until the goal is achieved (eg.&nbsp;the conjugate pair
collides). 
This is an application of numerical homotopy 
continuation&nbsp;[<A HREF="../bibliography.html#Ver99">Ve</A>]. 

<P>
While there is no guarantee that this method will even successfully collide
two conjugate solutions, Dietmaier uses it to find a sextuple of distances
with all 40 solutions real.
While at each step the solutions are only numerical
approximations to the actual solutions, the condition number 
<I>N</I> guarantees the existence of a genuine solution within 
1/<I>N</I>  of each approximate solution. 
Since the approximate real solutions were separated by more than 
2/<I>N</I>, the requirement that non-real solutions occur in complex
conjugate pairs forced these genuine solutions to be real.
