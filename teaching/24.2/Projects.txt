Toric Varieties, Fall 2024.

Projects for the end-of-semester presentations

(No one has yet told me officially what they are doing)



Suggestions (these are broad, we should discuss what one would actually do)

Arithmetic toric varieties
Toric varieties in algebraic statistics
A-Discriminant
Stanley's g- Theorem
Secondary fan of a point configuration and its Toric Variety
SAGBI (or Khovanskii) bases and toric varieties
Vertically parametrized polynomial systems
fewnomial bounds via Gale duality
Complexity one T-varieties (rational)
Irrational Toric Varieties
[Ask your advisor for a suggestion]


Topics from past semesters:

 "The A-Discriminant Amoeba Structure"
 "Gale diagrams for codimension 2 lattice ideals"
 "Geometry of complete intersection toric varieties"
 "A Toric Degeneration of the Grassmannian"
 "Vector bundles over toric varieties"
 "Real structures on toric varieties"
 "Toric Varieties Associated to Graphs"
 "Three-Dimensional Staircases"
 "Buchberger's algorithm for Groebner bases"  (Not appropriate)
