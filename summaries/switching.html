The (skew) shape $\lambda/\mu$ extends the shape $\mu/\nu$ when
$\lambda\supseteq \mu\subseteq \nu$ are partitions (identified with their
Young diagrams): a tableau is obtained by filling such a shape by integers
which increase weakly along rows and strictly down columns. A `switching'
algorithm is given which transforms a pair $(S,T)$ of tableaux, such that
the shape of $T$ extends the shape of $S$, into a new pair $(\sp ST, S\sb
T)$, such that the shape of $S\sb T$ extends the shape of $\sp ST$. The
algorithm consists of a sequence of exchanges of numbers from $S$ with
adjacent numbers to the right or below from $T$, subject only to the
condition that the exchange preserves the row and column conditions for the
numbers from $S$ and for the numbers from $T$. Thus the content of $\sp ST$
is the same as that of $T$, the content of $S\sb T$ is the same as that of
$S$, and the shape of $\sp ST\cup S\sb T$ is the same as that of $S\cup
T$.<P>

Remarkably, the tableaux $\sp ST$ and $S\sb T$ are independent of the
sequence of exchanges carried out. Further, the switching map can be defined
axiomatically as the unique such map of pairs of tableaux which is
compatible with decompositions, in a natural sense, of $S$ or $T$ as a
disjoint union of two subtableaux. The tableaux $\sp ST$ and $S\sb T$ are
Knuth equivalent to $T$ and to $S$ respectively, and the switching map is an
involution: if we start with $(\sp ST, S\sb T)$, then we recover
$(S,T)$.<P>

This switching procedure generalises similar algorithms constructed by
several authors and used to prove identities concerning inter alia Schur
functions, branching rules and Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, and so it
provides a uniform approach to these proofs. A variant of the procedure, in
which the tableaux $T$ and $\sp ST$ are row strict rather than column
strict, permits an application to work of Remmel on super-Schur
functions.<P>

Further applications of the switching procedure are given which relate to
Haiman's notion of `dual equivalence' for tableaux and to Schuetzenberger's
`evacuation procedure'. This leads to the concept of the reverse $U\sp e$ of
an arbitrary skew tableau $U$: $U\sp e$ is the unique tableau which is dual
equivalent to $U$ (and so has the same shape as $U$) and is Knuth equivalent
to the tableau $U\sp*$ obtained by rotating $U$ $180\sp \circ$ and changing
the sign of each entry. In the case where the shape of $U$ is the Young
diagram of a partition, $U\sp e$ coincides with the evacuation $U\sp E$ of
$U$. The involution $U\mapsto U\sp{e*}$ provides an explicit bijection
between tableaux of rotated shape having the same content, and this is used
to give an elegant proof that the skew Schur functions corresponding to
rotated shapes are equal. Symmetries of Littlewood-Richardson coefficients
due to Berenstein and Zelevinsky are similarly obtained.<br>
