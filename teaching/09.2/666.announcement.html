<font size=+1 color=brown>Math 666:  Tropical Geometry</font>

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Tropical geometry is an emerging mathematical discipline at the
crossroads of algebraic geometry and geometric combinatorics.
It arose simultaneously and independently from enumerative geometry,
phylogenetic inference, computational algebraic geometry, symplectic
geometry, and control theory, and it has led to insights and new
results in these areas.   It may be regarded as the geometry that
one obtains upon replacing the arithmetical operations of addition
and multiplication by maximum and sum.

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; 
In this course, I will develop tropical geometry, with a particular
emphasis on basic objects such as tropical linear spaces and polytopes,
relations to matroids, tropical curves and their Jacobians.  This will
give a basis for the use of tropical geometry in phylogenetic
inference, in computational algebraic geometry, and in enumerative
geometry.

<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The course will use a draft of a text book by Maclagan-Sturmfels,
as well as other material including notes from an short course on
tropical enumerative geometry and material derived from recent
research papers, some of which will be presented by students for their
grade.   My goal will be to introduce students to some of the
current research featured in the Semester at the MSRI on this
topic next Autumn.   We will also have several guest speakers
from that semester.
