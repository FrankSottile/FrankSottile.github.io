* Handout `Deadbeat Control'
* Handout `Observability'

* Recall
  - Nilpotent characterization of deadbeat control
  - Discuss the resulting system of polynomial equations
  - Characteristic polynomial characterization
  - resulting polynomial characterization

* Discuss the example/computation

* Pole placement problem

  - n equations in mp variables of degree n, n-1, ..., 2, 1.
  - Is a further reduction possible?

* Control with dynamic compensators

 - dynamic pole placement problem.
    n+q equations in n^2+qp+qm+mp variables.

   ? Is a further reduction possible ?


----------------------------------------------------------

 - Matrix manipulations to get the transfer function format.

[
 - Aside on why it is called transfer function
]

State Theorem on coprime factorization

Use it to get a geometric form of the pole placement problem.

Motivate part of the rest of the course

Begin to study polynomial matrices
