You do need to finish your <a href="../Second_paper.html">Second Paper </a> this week.
<!-------------------------------------------------------------->
<HR>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------->
I will be putting up information about your term paper later this month.
Rough instructions are:
This should be about 2500-3000 words, or a comparable project in another medium.
The topic is your choice, but (like the book) it should involve a nontrivial amount of history and a nontrivial amount of mathematics.
Note that contemporary topics are OK.
If you already have ideas, or want to discuss this, feel free to write me on Piazza.

<font color=maroon><h3>Week 9: 9 March 2020. </h3></font>
<ul>
  <li><font color=maroon><B>Opening Remarks:</b></font><br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; 
  This week's reading is first on mechanics, which is an important influence of physics on Mathematics.
  As an algebraist, physics major, and now applied mathemetician, I appreciate these topics.
  This is slightly out of place, as it predates and motivates the Calculus, but then continues quite a bit past the time of calculus.
<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; The chapter on mechanics covers a lot of history, from the late medieval period until 1900.
  This begins with relations between velocity, acceleration, and distance, and ends with
  chaotic motion and fluid mechanics.
  I suspect that the compression of topics is due to Stilwell's interests, and probably also the need to keep the book from getting too long.

  <li><font color=maroon><B>Reading:</b></font>
   <ul>

    <li>
     Chapter 13 in Stillwell's book.   Pages 262&ndash;263 are a bit cumbersome, and Fulling has a succinct and easy summary
     of <a href="../pdfs/wave.pdf">d'Alembert's derivation of the wave equation</a>.
    </li> 
   <li>
    Chapter 17 in Stillwell's book.
    While differential geometry is a 19th century topic, this can be read just after Chapter 13 (next week, we do the three in between).
    </li> 
    <li>Watch the Numberphile video about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi-TBlh44gY">curvature and eating Pizza</a>.
        Here in Berlin, I eat Pizza with a sharp knife and a fork, as it is served, uncut, on a plate at Italian restaurants.
   </ul>
  </li>

 <li><font color=maroon><b>Assignment:</b></font> Due Monday, <font color=red>23 March 2020</font>. (HW 10)<br>
   <b><font color=maroon>To hand in:</font></b>  <font color=red>We are using E-campus for homework submission</font>.
  <ol>
    <li>Exercises 13.5.1 and 13.5.2.</li>
    <li>Do the steps in Fulling's explanation of <a href="../pdfs/wave.pdf">d'Alembert's  derivation of the wave equation</a>.
    <li>With your second paper coming due, I will <font color=red>not assign</font> more problems from Chapter 17, for now.<br>

    <!--  Next time, have them do the problems on spherical geoetry at the end of Chapter 17, as well as the Pizza+curvature Numberphile -->

    Here is a <a href="../pdfs/partial_derivatives.pdf">handout</a> I created for a course in differential equations
    at the University of Toronto, when the students needed a proof that mixed partials derivatives commuted.
    It, like the differential equations course I had in 1982 at Michigan State was proof-based (the instructor gave careful proofs of all results,
    including existence and uniqueness of solutions to ordinaray differential equations; and this was Differential Equations for Engineers.)
