From the introduction: "Of the geometric figures in a given family
satisfying real conditions, some figures are real while the rest occur
in complex conjugate pairs, and the distribution of the two types
depends subtly upon the configuration of the conditions. Despite this
difficulty, applications may demand real solutions. W. Fulton [
Introduction to intersection theory in algebraic geometry, Conf. Board Math.
Sci., Washington, DC, 1984; MR 85j:14008] asked how many solutions of an
enumerative problem
can be real. We consider a special case of his question: Given a
problem of enumerative geometry, are there real conditions such that
every figure satisfying them is real? Such an enumerative problem is
fully real.

"This note is organized as follows: In $&#167;2$ we discuss some examples
of fully real enumerative problems for which multiplicity-free
deformations play a central role. This technique is illustrated in
$&#167;3$, where we show that there are nine real Veronese surfaces in
${<strong>P</strong>}\sp 5$ such that the 11 010 048 planes meeting all nine are
real. Next is a discussion of the work of F. Ronga, A. Tognoli and T. Vust
[Rev. Mat. Univ. Complut. Madrid 10 (1997), no. 2, 391--421; MR 99d:14059] on
the problem of conics. We conclude with a description of some
computational work on related questions and a conjecture of Shapiro
and Shapiro regarding the second question above."
