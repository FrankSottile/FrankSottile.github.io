    <TR valign=top><TD><FONT COLOR=AA00FF><B>Pace</B>:</FONT></TD>
    <TD>In multivariate Calculus (in colloquial slang "Calc 3"), the material comes rather fast, and its difficulty rises
      markedly with each chapter.
      The first, vectors and some geometry in <b>R</b><sup>3</sup>, is a basis for what comes later.
      We next study differential calculus in 2- and 3- variables, culminating in the fundamentally useful method of Lagrange
      multipliers for constrained optimization.
      Then integration with more than one variable.
      A saving grace of these middle topics is that differentiation and integration are carried out "one variable at a
      time", so it is only a mild generalization of your previous two semesters.
      The same cannot quite be said about the last topic, which is best to think of as the fundamental theorem of calculus
      in this new setting.
      This last bit, conservative vector fields, as well as the theorems of Green, Stokes, and  Gau&szlig;, point to further
      concepts in higher mathematics in a way that you may not have seen before.
      All of these concepts, while delivered in the familiar <b>R</b><sup>2</sup> and  <b>R</b><sup>3</sup>, have a
      straightforward generalization to all (finite) dimensions.
      I always cover all these topics, in full, so strap yourselves in for a ride this semester.

      <TD>While the previous section on Pace mentioned some slightly advanced aspects of my course, I want to further
	point out that this course will meet the enhanced learning objectives of an honors course by the use of richer

    <TD>Your goal in this course, as in every course that you ever
      take, should be a complete mastery of the material.  Anything less is
      aspiring to mediocrity and doing yourself a disservice.  
      I expect you to read the section in the text that we will be covering
      <font color=red><i>before</i></font> we meet.
      Come to class ready to ask questions about what you do not yet know.
      After class, <font color=red><i>re-read</i></font> the text and your notes,
      and do some exercises to complete your mastery of the material.
      Finally, ask questions in class, lots of them.<br>

<font color=red> <b>CoViD Statement</b></font>:    

To help protect Aggieland and stop the spread of COVID-19, Texas A&amp;M University urges students to be vaccinated and to wear masks in
classrooms and all other academic facilities on campus, including labs.  Doing so exemplifies the Aggie Core Values of respect, leadership,
integrity, and selfless service by putting community concerns above individual preferences. COVID-19 vaccines and masking&mdash;regardless of
vaccination status&mdash;have been shown to be safe and effective at reducing spread to others, infection, hospitalization, and death.<br>


<hr>--------------------------->
<B>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Policy Statement</B><BR>

Texas A&amp;M University is committed to providing equitable access to learning opportunities for all students. If you experience barriers to
your education due to a disability or think you may have a disability, please contact the Disability Resources office on your campus
(resources listed below) Disabilities may include, but are not limited to attentional, learning, mental health, sensory, physical, or
chronic health conditions. All students are encouraged to discuss their disability related needs with Disability Resources and their
instructors as soon as possible.<br>

Disability Resources is located in the Student Services Building or at (979) 845-1637 or visit
<a title="Disability Services" href="https://disability.tamu.edu/"><tt>disability.tamu.edu</tt></a>.<br><br>


<b>Academic Integrity Statement</b><br> 
"<font color=maroon>An Aggie does not lie, cheat, or steal or tolerate those who do</font>." 
For more, see the <A title"Aggie Honor Code" HREF="https://aggiehonor.tamu.edu/Rules-and-Procedures/Rules/Honor-System-Rules">Honor Council Rules and Procedures</A>. <br> <br>

<b>Title IX and Statement on Limits to Confidentiality</b><br>

Texas A&amp;M University is committed to fostering a learning environment that is safe and productive for all.
University policies and federal and state laws prohibit gender-based discrimination and sexual harassment,
including sexual assault, sexual exploitation, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking.<br>

With the exception of some medical and mental health providers, all university employees
(including full and part-time faculty, staff, paid graduate assistants, student workers, etc.) are Mandatory Reporters
and must report to the Title IX Office if the employee experiences, observes, or becomes aware of an incident that meets
the following conditions (see University Rule <a title="SAP title IX rule" href="https://rules-saps.tamu.edu/PDFs/08.01.01.M1.pdf"><tt>08.01.01.M1</tt></a>):
  <ul>
    <li>The incident is reasonably believed to be discrimination or harassment. </li>
    <li>The incident is alleged to have been committed by or against a person who, at the time of the incident,
      was (1) a student enrolled at the University or (2) an employee of the University. </li>
 </ul>

Mandatory Reporters must file a report regardless of how the information comes to their attention&ndash;including but not limited to
  face-to-face conversations, a written class assignment or paper, class discussion, email, text, or social media post. Although Mandatory
  Reporters must file a report, in most instances, a person who is subjected to the alleged conduct will be able to control how the report
  is handled, including whether or not to pursue a formal investigation. The University's goal is to make sure you are aware of the range of
  options available to you and to ensure access to the resources you need. <br>

  Students wishing to discuss concerns in a confidential setting are encouraged to make an appointment with
  <a title="CAPS" href="https://caps.tamu.edu/">Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)</a>.<br> 

Students can learn more about filing a report, accessing supportive resources, and navigating the Title IX investigation and resolution
  process on the University's <a title="Title IX reports" href="https://titleix.tamu.edu/">Title IX webpage</a>.<br><br>



<b>Statement on Mental Health and Wellness</b>
<br>

Texas A&amp;M University recognizes that mental health and wellness are critical factors that influence a student's academic success and overall
wellbeing. Students are encouraged to engage in healthy self-care by utilizing available resources and services on campus.<br>


Students who need someone to talk to can contact 
<a title="CAPS" href="https://caps.tamu.edu/">Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (CAPS)<a> or call the  TAMU Helpline (979-845-2700) from 4:00
    p.m. to 8:00 a.m. weekdays and 24 hours on weekends. 24-hour emergency help is also available through the National Suicide Prevention
Hotline (800-273-8255) or at <a title="Suicide Prevention" href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/">suicidepreventionlifeline.org</a>.
<br>
   <br>

    <b>Statement on Academic Freedom</b><br>
    
    Institutions of higher education exist for the common good.
    The common good depends upon an uninhibited search for truth and its open expression.
    Hence, it is essential that faculty members be free to pursue scholarly inquiry without undue restriction, and to voice
    and publish individual conclusions concerning the significance of evidence that they consider relevant.
    Each faculty member must be free from the corrosive fear that others inside or outside the University community,
    because their views may differ, may threaten his or her professional career or the material benefits accruing from it.
    Each faculty member is entitled to full freedom in the classroom in discussing the subject being taught.
