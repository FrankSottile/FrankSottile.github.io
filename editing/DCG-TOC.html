<H3>FOREWORD</H3>

This special issue contains ten papers in "Geometric Combinatorics". 
The papers were collected on the occasion of a pair of meetings in California: 
the special session of <I>Algebraic and Geometric Combinatorics</I> at the 
AMS Western section meeting in San Francisco (October 21-22, 2000) and 
the launching of the Bay Area Discrete  Math Day at the University of 
California at Davis (October 20, 2000).


<P>
"Geometric Combinatorics" refers to the interaction between discrete 
geometry and combinatorics. Convex polytopes, monomial ideals, oriented 
matroids, simplicial complexes, hyperplane arrangements are examples of 
geometric objects that encode combinatorial information. Applications
across the mathematical sciences are numerous: for instance, the use
of Newton polytopes and simplicial complexes in algebraic geometry and
commutative algebra.  At the same time the geometric objects above provide 
a wealth of enumerative and algebraic questions for combinatorialists. 
An example is the theory of <I>f</I>-vectors of polytopes.

<P>
Recently the study of <I>f</I>-vectors of convex polytopes has involved
algebraic techniques represented by the <B>cd</B>-index. In the first
paper the author discusses Infinitesimal Hopf algebras which give a
general setting allowing one to lift the notions of M&ouml;obius function,
<B>ab</B>-index, <B>cd</B>-index and <I>eulerian</I>, all commonly
studied for polytopes or geometric complexes, to more general
combinatorial objects. One of his results gives a simple and
conceptual proof of the existence of the <B>cd</B>-index for eulerian posets.

<P>
The second paper provides an exact formula for the number of triangulations 
of the cyclic (<I>n</I>-4)-polytope with <I>n</I> vertices. The only other nontrivial 
closed formula counting triangulations of a polytope is that of the convex 
<I>n</I>-gon, the Catalan numbers. This paper is a step towards developing general 
tools for enumerating triangulations.

<P>
Multiplexes are self-dual polytopes whose specific combinatorial
properties resemble certain properties of simplices.  Ordinary
polytopes generalize cyclic polytopes in the following sense: Their
facets are multiplexes, where as the facets of cyclic polytopes are
simplices; and they admit a vertex facet incidence matrix which
satisfies Gale's evenness criterion. The third paper deals with
completely describing the face lattice of multiplexes.

<P>
For a hyperplane arrangement <I>A</I>, Orlik and Terao  constructed a
certain commutative algebra <I>U</I>(<I>A</I>). In the fourth paper the author
introduces a combinatorial analog of the algebra <I>U</I>(<I>A</I>).  Namely,
for an oriented matroid <I>M</I>, he constructs a commutative algebra <I>A</I>(<I>M</I>)
that recovers the Orlik-Terao algebra <I>U</I>(<I>A</I>) when <I>M</I> is the oriented matroid
of a hyperplane arrangement <I>A</I>.  The results are then used
to give a negative answer to a question by Terao and Orlik: is
<I>U</I>(<I>A</I>) determined by the intersection lattice of <I>A</I>?


<P>
In the fifth paper the authors describe a family of polytopes whose
lattice points exhibit a beautiful structure. The purely geometric 
description has a surprising algebraic consequences and gives a result 
on the minimum size of representations of sums of squares of polynomials, 
using the Newton polytope of the polynomial.

<P>
The main result of the sixth paper clarifies the relationship between two 
simplicial complexes naturally associated with a normal semigroup ring. The
author gives a new and purely topological proof of the theorem of Danilov 
and Stanley describing  the canonical module of a normal semigroup ring as the
lattice points in the relative interior of the corresponding polyhedral cone.

<P>
The seventh paper introduces and studies the topology of three
simplicial complexes: convex, acyclic, and free sets, all associated
with an oriented matroid. These concepts were previously studied in diverse
contexts. The main result of the paper states that for any
simple oriented matroid the three complexes are in fact homotopy
equivalent to each other and to either sphere or a point.

<P>
Oriented matroids also present interesting algorithmic problems.  In
the eighth paper, the authors propose algorithms for generating 
single-element extensions of a given oriented matroid. The algorithms 
make interesting use of the tope graph and the cocircuit graph.

<P>
The ninth paper is related to the well-known Evasiveness Conjecture
for simplicial complexes and its generalizations.  The main contribution 
of the paper is the construction of many  examples of <I>Z</I>-acyclic 
vertex-homogenous simplicial complexes which are important `obstructions' 
to a general proof of the conjecture.

<P>
The last paper deals with triangulations of oriented matroids, a topic of
interest not only in oriented matroid theory but also in connection to
the "combinatorial differential manifolds" introduced by R. MacPherson
in the 1990's.  This paper presents a family of
triangulations with very nice topological behavior.

<P>
We are grateful to Jacob E. Goodman and Richard Pollack for their 
enthusiastic support of this issue and to the referees for their
hard work resulting in many helpful comments and corrections.
