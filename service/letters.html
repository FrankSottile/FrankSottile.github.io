     &nbsp; &nbsp;
     Writing letters of recommendation is one of the most important things that I do.
     I take this task seriously; people's livelihoods as well as the functioning of our
     profession rests upon thoughtful, well-written letters.
     I also do this a fair amount, writing about 40 letters every year for a variety of reasons,
     from tenure and promotion to job applications to fellowships to graduate school
     applications to funding for travel, and for many other reasons.

<p>
&nbsp; &nbsp;
I am very willing to write a letter for a deserving candidate
(which you presumably are).
However, I need your help for this process to work.
Please try to keep the following in mind:

<ul>

 <li>
   <font color=blue>Time</font> &nbsp;
    I need to schedule time for this task.
    Contact me as soon as possible so that I can put this on my schedule;  
    preferably three weeks before the deadline.
    During the peak period October&mdash;early December I may need two months.
 </li>

 <li>
   <font color=blue>Task</font> &nbsp;
    Clear statement of what you are applying for (so that I know the task at hand).
 </li>

 <li>  
  <font color=blue>Deadlines</font> &nbsp;
   Deadline and information on submitting the letter.
 </li>

 <li>
  <font color=blue>Statement</font> &nbsp;
  Any materials that you have with your application;
  CV, statement of purpose, application essay, research statement, etc.
 </li>

 <li>
  <font color=blue>Meeting</font> &nbsp;
   If possible, we should meet to talk about your application.
   This is particularly important for undergraduate students, as I
   typically need to be educated about you and what you are applying for.
 </li>
 
</ul>

<font color=red>
  I can no longer write a new letter without several week's notice.
  I used to do this occasionally, but my good will has been taken advantage of too many times.
