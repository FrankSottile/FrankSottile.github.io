  In 1984, Fulton asked how many solutions to a problem of enumerative
geometry can be real, when that problem is one of counting geometric figures
of some kind having specified position with respect to some general fixed
figures.  For the problem of plane conics tangent to five general conics,
the (surprising) answer is that all 3264 may be real.  Such questions arise
also in applications; recently, Dietmaier has shown that all 40 positions of
the Stewart platform in robotics may be real.

  The purpose of this talk is to give the elementary proof that a certain
enumerative problem of counting rational curves on a Grassmannian coming
from quantum coholomology can have all of its solutions be real.  The proof
illustrates a new method, based upon homotopy continuation and using Schuebt
induction for finding lower bounds on the maximal numberof real solutions to
some enumerative problems.   This method is the analog for homogeneous
spaces fo Viro's method, or toric deformations.   We also use this result to
deduce some new results about rational plane curves with maximally many real
inflection points.

The picture above shows this phenomenon for the case degree 0 curves in the
Grassmannian of lines in projective 3-space, which was known classically.
