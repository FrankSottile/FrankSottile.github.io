Orbitopes

  An orbitope is the convex hull of an orbit of a compact 
group acting linearly on a vector space.  Instances of these
highly symmetric conex bodies have appeared in many areas 
of mathematics and its applications, including protein 
reconstruction, symplectic geometry, and calibrations in 
differential geometry.
  In this talk, I will discuss Orbitopes from the perpectives 
of classical convexity, algebraic geometry, and optimization
with an emphasis on motivating questions and concrete examples.
This is joint work with Raman Sanyal and Bernd Sturmfels.
