<P>
The purpose of this talk will be to describe how geometry 
is used to study a specific problem in control theory.  
While intended for graduate students, all are welcome, and 
the talk will only assume some familiarity with the 
undergraduate topics of polynomials, systems of linear 
differential equations, and some linear algebra.  In 
particular, everything described below will be explained 
from first principles.

<P>
Suppose we have a driven physical system whose evolution 
is governed by a system of linear differential equations.  
If we use some measured outputs of the system to drive the 
system (via a static linear feedback law) then the elementary 
theory of linear differential equations tells us that the
behaviour of the resulting closed system is encapsulated by 
its characteristic polynomial.

<P>
The pole placement problem asks, given such a driven linear 
physical system, for which feedback laws will the resulting 
closed system have a given characteristic polynomial?  
Interestingly, this (apparently linear) problem turns out to 
be highly non-linear, and its analysis uses some ideas from
classical algebraic geometry, including Grassmannians and the 
Schubert calculus.  We describe the pole placement problem, 
its relation to geometry, and also its resolution using the 
Schubert calculus.
