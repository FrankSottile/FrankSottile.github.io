The Horn recursion in the cominuscule Schubert calculus

   A  consequence   of  Knutson  and  Tao's   proof  of  the
saturation conjecture is a conjecture of Horn, which implies
that the  non-vanishing of Littlewood-Richardson  numbers is
recursive: A Littlewood-Richardson number is non-zero if and
only if its partition  indices satisfy the Horn inequalities
imposed  by  all  `smaller'  non-zero  Littlewood-Richardson
numbers.   A way  to  express this  Horn  Recursion is  that
non-vanishing in the Schubert  calculus of a Grassmannian is
controlled by non-vanishing in  the Schubert calculus of all
smaller Grassmannians.

   This  talk will  discuss  joint work  with Kevin  Purbhoo
extending this  Horn recursion to the  Schubert calculus for
all  cominuscule  flag   varieties,  which  are  analogs  of
Grassmannians for other reductive groups.  In particular, we
give  two very  different sets  of necessary  and sufficient
inequalities  for  the   non-vanishing  of  the  analogs  of
Littlewood-Richardson numbers for Schur P- and Q- functions.
Interestingly, the  inequalities we obtain  for the ordinary
Littlewood-Richardson  numbers are  different than  the Horn
inequalities.
