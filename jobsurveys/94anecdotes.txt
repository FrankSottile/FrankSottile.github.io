Item #3  JOB SURVEY RESULTS -- PART 2

This article and its sequel both concern the comments taken from the survey
responses.  First, there were a number of individuals who sent me their
best guesses for how the graduate students at their school were doing on
the job market at the time of the responses.  I have blanked out the name
of the schools but left in some general description below.

Date of
Response        University or location           Results

5/12            Top 10 school           8/10 had offers
                                        5 have multi-year offers
                                        3 have 1 year offers
                                        2 have nothing

6/22            Midwestern U.           4/8 had offers
                                        2 have tenure track offers
                                        1 has a 1-year position in U.S.
                                        1 has a 1-year position in Mideast
                                        4 have nothing

5/19            Large Midwest U.        all but 1 received offer (no details
                                        and the respondent was unsure)

5/28            Large Midwest U.        3 have "decent" offers
                                        10 have nothing
                                        ? others

5/10            Western U.              3/9 have offers

5/11            Western U.              1/5 has an offer (1-yr)

5/1             Large Midwest U.        1/4 - 1/2 of all PhD's had offers

5/12            Large Midwest U.        2/10 had offers

It is almost certainly the case that many of those above with nothing will
receive 1-year positions or mercy graduate extensions, particularly since
most of the responses came in during the month of May.  Since these 1-year
positions are often horrible though, I take little comfort in this fact.

What seems to be clear is that getting a job offer by early May when you
are fresh out of graduate school is a crap shoot right now.  In the next
few weeks I will be posting general comments taken from the survey (all
will be posted anonymously).
