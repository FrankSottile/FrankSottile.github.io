<B>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Policy Statement</B><BR>

The following ADA Policy Statement (part of the Policy on Individual Disabling
Conditions) was submitted to the University Curriculum Committee by the Department of
Student Life. The policy statement was forwarded to the Faculty Senate for information. 
<BR>
<blockquote>
<em>
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal
anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights
protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this
legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a
learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their
disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring an
accommodation, please contact the Department of Student Life, Services
for Students with Disabilities, in Room 126 of the Koldus Building or
call 845-1637.
</em>
</blockquote>

<b>Academic Integrity Statement</b> 
"<font color=maroon>An Aggie does not lie, cheat, or steal or tolerate those who do</font>."

<b>Title IX and Statement on Limits to Confidentiality</b>
 Texas A&amp;M University and the College of Science are committed to fostering a learning environment that is safe and productive for all. 
 University policies and federal and state laws provide guidance for achieving such an environment.
 Although class materials are generally considered confidential pursuant to student record policies and laws, University employees&ndash;including
 instructors&ndash;cannot mantain confidentiality when it conflicts with their responsibility to report certain issues that jeopardize the health and safety of our
 community. 
 As the instructor, I must report (per Texas A&M System Regulation 08.01.01) the following information to other University offices if you share it with me, even if
 you do not want the disclosed information to be shared:
<ul>
  <li>Allegations of sexual assault, sexual discrimination, or sexual harassment when they involve TAMU students, faculty, or staff, or third parties visiting
     campus.</li>
</ul>
 These reports may trigger contact from a campus official who will want to talk with you about the incident that you have shared.
 In many cases, it will be your decision whether or not you wish to speak with that individual.
  If you would like to talk about these events in a more confidential setting, you are encouraged to make an appointment with the Student Counseling Service
 <a href="https://scs.tamu.edu/">(https://scs.tamu.edu/)</a>.<br>

 Students and faculty can report non-emergency behavior that causes them to be concerned at
