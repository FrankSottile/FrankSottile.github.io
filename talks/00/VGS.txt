Some real and unreal enumerative geometry

   Fulton asked how many solutions to a problem of enumerative geometry can
be real, when that problem is one of counting geometric figures of some kind
having specified position with respect to some general fixed figures. For
the problem of plane conics tangent to five general conics, the (surprising)
answer is that all 3264 may be real. Such questions arise also in
applications; recently, Dietmaier has shown that all 40 positions of the
Stewart platform in robotics may be real.

   The purpose of this talk is to describe a general method for constructing
real solutions to some enumerative problems. This method is based upon
homotopy continuation algorithms and is an analog of Viro's method, or toric
deformations. We describe how this method may be used to show that some
classical problems in enumerative geometry may have all their solutions be
real, and apply it to give a classical problem for which we may have no real
solutions. Some extensive calculations lead to intriguing conjectures on the
general situation for many such Schubert-type enumerative problems.
