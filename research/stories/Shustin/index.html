We construct maximally inflected curves of degree <I>d</I> with the maximum number
(<I>d</I>-1)(<I>d</I>-2)/2 nodes by deforming a particular reducible curve in a
precise way using Shustin's theory&nbsp;[<A HREF="#Sh99">Sh99</A>] 
to control the singularities in
the deformation. 
The idea for this comes from the two degree 4 curves pictured below.
The curve on the right is a deformation of the reducible curve on the left.

Specifically, the reducible curve is defined by 
<CENTER>
  <I>xy</I> (3(<I>x</I> - <I>y</I>)<SUP>2</SUP>
    + (3<I>x</I> + 3<I>y</I> - 4)<SUP>2</SUP> - 4) &nbsp; = &nbsp; 0&nbsp;,
</CENTER>
and is the union of the 2 coordinate axes and an ellipse.
The curve on the right is defined by the polynomial obtained by subtracting
<CENTER>
  (1/20)(<I>x</I> + <I>y</I>)<SUP>2</SUP>(<I>x</I> + <I>y</I> - 1)<SUP>2</SUP>
</CENTER>
from the equation of the reducible curve.
This deforming term defines two parallel lines passing through the
singularities of the reducible curve.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
The quartic curve on the right has 2 solitary points at (1,0) and (0,1)
and a node at the origin.
By the genus formula, it is rational.
It also has 6 flexes.
Four are indicated by circles, and there is one more along each asymptote, as
the curvature of the segment of the curve along the asymptote is different
in each of the visible branches.
(The tubular neighborhood of an axis is a M&ouml;bius band.)
Thus any parameterization of this curve is a maximally inflected quartic with
6 flexes, 1 node, and 2 solitary points.

<HR>
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
The more sophisticated ideas needed for the general construction are provided
by Shustin's theory.
We describe the ingredients of this deformation, verify that it is
valid, and lastly show that the curve we constructed has the desired properties.

Fix an integer <I>d</I> > 2 throughout and let <I>P</I><SUB>0</SUB> 
be the union of a conic and any
<I>d</I>-2 distinct lines tangent to the conic.
Then <I>P</I><SUB>0</SUB> is a reducible curve of degree <I>d</I>.
Each pair of tangents meet and no three meet in a point as the dual curve to
the conic is another conic.
Thus <I>P</I><SUB>0</SUB> has 
(<I>d</I>-2)(<I>d</I>-3)/2 simple nodes and <I>d</I>-2 other singularities
at the points of tangency.
We deform those tangency singularities while preserving the nodes.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
In a neighborhood <I>V</I> of each point of tangency, 
<I>P<SUB>d</SUB></I> is isomorphic to the
reducible curve <I>K</I><SUB>0</SUB> given by the equation
<CENTER>
  <I>y</I>(<I>y</I> - <I>x</I><SUP>2</SUP>) &nbsp; = &nbsp; 0&nbsp;,
</CENTER>
in some neighborhood <I>U</I> of the origin.
For each <I>t</I> in <B>R</B>, let <I>K<SUB>t</SUB></I> be the deformation of 
<I>K</I><SUB>0</SUB> defined in <I>U</I> by
<A NAME="Kt"></A>

For <I>t</I> positive but sufficiently small, <I>K<SUB>t</SUB></I> has a
solitary point at the origin and 2 flexes along each branch near the 
parabola <I>y</I>=<I>x</I><SUP>2</SUP>, but within <I>U</I>.
Moreover, it lies above the <I>x</I>-axis.
We display the reducible curve on the left and the deformation
<I>K<SUB>t</SUB></I> for <I>t</I>=1/15 on the right.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
If a certain cohomology group vanishes, then 
Shustin's Theorem&nbsp;[Theorem&nbsp;1 in <A HREF="#Sh99">Sh99</A>] 
guarantees the existence of a real
number <I>e</I>>0 and of a deformation 
<I>P<SUB>t</SUB></I> of the curve <I>P</I><SUB>0</SUB> for 
<I>t</I> in the interval (0,<I>e</I>) such that (1)
<I>P<SUB>t</SUB></I> has degree <I>d</I>, (2) <I>P<SUB>t</SUB></I> has a node in
a neighbourhood of each node of <I>P</I><SUB>0</SUB>, and 
(3) in a neighborhood <I>V</I> of
each point of tangency of <I>P</I><SUB>0</SUB>, <I>P<SUB>t</SUB></I> 
is isomorphic to <I>K<SUB>t</SUB></I>, in the
neighborhood <I>U</I> of the origin.
Another result of Shustin&nbsp;[Lemma&nbsp;3 in <A HREF="#Sh99">Sh99</A>]
gives the numerical criterion 
for the vanishing of this cohomology group

the sum over all singular points <I>z</I> of the curve <I>P</I><SUB>0</SUB>,
where <I>X<SUB>z</SUB></I> is the scheme of the singularity 
<I>z</I> and isd<SUB><I>z</I></SUB> is a positive integer.
When <I>z</I> is a node, <I>X<SUB>z</SUB></I> has multiplicity 1, 
and when <I>z</I> is a point of
tangency, <I>X<SUB>z</SUB></I> has multiplicity 2.
Thus the above sum is at most <I>d</I>-2, and so the deformation exists.
 
<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
For 0 < <I>t</I> < <I>e</I>, the curve <I>P<SUB>t</SUB></I> has 
(<I>d</I>-2)(<I>d</I>-3)/2 nodes and <I>d</I>-2
solitary points, by the construction.
Since it has degree <I>d</I>, it is rational.
Also from the construction, we see that each solitary point contributes 2
flexes, accounting for 2(<I>d</I>-2) flexes.
Furthermore, there is an additional flex along each asymptote (the original
tangent lines) as the concavity of <I>P<SUB>t</SUB></I>  changes while passing
through infinity.
Thus any parameterization of the curve <I>P<SUB>t</SUB></I> 
gives a maximally inflected
curve of degree <I>d</I> with 3(<I>d</I>-2) flexes, (<I>d</I>-2)(<I>d</I>-3)/2
nodes and <I>d</I>-2 
solitary points.


Here is a picture of the reducible curve and the maximally inflected
deformation, when <I>d</I>=5.

<B>Theorem. </B>
 For each <I>k</I> between 0 and <I>d</I>-2,  there is a maximally inflected
 curve with <I>k</I> cusps, 3(<I>d</I>-2)-2<I>k</I> flexes, 
 <I>d</I>-2-<I>k</I> solitary points, and
 (<I>d</I>-2)(<I>d</I>-3)/2 nodes.

<B> Proof . </B>
 In the previous construction, we may replace the local model
 <I>K<SUB>t</SUB></I> defined in&nbsp;(<A HREF="#Kt">1</A>) 
 by the local model <I>L<SUB>t</SUB></I> defined by
<A NAME="Lt"></A>

  <TR>
  <TD width=100></TD><TD align=center>
   <I>y</I>(<I>y</I> - <I>x</I><SUP>2</SUP>) + 
    <I>tx</I><SUP>3</SUP> &nbsp; = &nbsp; 0&nbsp;.
   </TD><TD align=right width=100>(2)</TD>
  </TR>
 </TABLE>
</CENTER>
 For <I>t</I> > 0,  <I>L<SUB>t</SUB></I> has a cusp at the origin and one flex
 near the origin. 
 We display <I>L<SUB>t</SUB></I> for <I>t</I>=1/10 with the singular curve
 <I>L</I> <SUB>0</SUB> on the left.

   <TD width=30></TD>
   <TD><IMG SRC="Kt.gif"></TD>
   <TD width=30></TD>
  </TR>
 </TABLE>
</CENTER>
 For every tangency point where we use the local perturbation 
 <I>L<SUB>t</SUB></I>, we will
 get a cusp, no solitary point, and only one flex; the flex along the tangent
 line does not appear, as the concavity of <I>L<SUB>t</SUB></I> does not
 change along  that line.

<TABLE><TR valign=center>
 <TD valign=center>
  &nbsp; &nbsp;
  The result follows as we may do this for any of the <I>d</I>-2 tangency
  points.</TD>
 <TD><IMG SRC="qed.gif"></TD></TR>
</TABLE>


<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
For <I>t</I> > 0, the cusp in the curve 
<I>L<SUB>t</SUB></I>&nbsp;(<A HREF="#Lt">2</A>) is on the branch to the
left of the origin.
Had we instead used the perturbation <I>M<SUB>t</SUB></I> given by
<CENTER>
  <I>y</I>(<I>y</I> - <I>x</I><SUP>2</SUP>) &nbsp;-&nbsp; 
  <I>tx</I><SUP>3</SUP> &nbsp; = &nbsp; 0&nbsp;,
</CENTER>
then the cusp is now on the right branch for <I>t</I>>0.
There are 3<SUP><I>d</I>-2</SUP> different ways to 
use one of these three local models 
<I>K<SUB>t</SUB></I>, <I>L<SUB>t</SUB></I>, or <I>M<SUB>t</SUB></I> for
the perturbation of the tangency singularities.
Not all give topologically distinct curves, as there are some symmetries;
for example, each of the 2(<I>d</I>-2) ways to have a single cusp are the same
topologically.
Also, not all possibilities for ordering of cusps and flexes along the curve
<I>P<SUB>t</SUB></I> is possible;
On any such curve, each cusp is either preceded or followed by a flex.
Thus for instance, we cannot obtain three consecutive cusps with this
construction.
