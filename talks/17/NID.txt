Numerical Irreducible Decomposition for Multiprojective Varieties

Subvarieties of a product of projective spaces (multiprojective
varieties) have natural representations in numerical algebraic
geometry through multiprojective witness sets, which have significantly
lower complexity than a classical witness set for these varieties.  
Algorithms based on multiprojective witness sets take advantage of 
the inherent structure of multiprojective varieties.

This talk will describe numerical irreducible decomposition in 
this setting, paying attention to how it exploits the structure
of multiprojective varieties.  It represents joint work with 
Leykin and Rodriguez.
