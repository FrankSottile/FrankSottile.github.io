Gale duality for complete intersections

Frank Sottile

Gale duality for polynomial systems is an elementary 
reformulation of a system of polynomial equations as 
a system of equations involving rational master functions 
in the complement of a hyperplane arrangement. Some 
properties of the original system are easier to understand 
in the Gale dual system. In the first part of this talk, 
I will describe this Gale duality, look at some examples 
of this construction, and give some elementary consequences.
