<b>Abstract:</b><br>
    We define skew Schubert polynomials to be normal form (polynomial) 
    representatives of certain classes in the cohomology of a flag manifold. 
    This definition extends a recent construction of Schubert polynomials 
    due to Bergeron and Sottile in terms of certain increasing labeled chains 
    in the Bruhat order of the symmetric group. These skew Schubert polynomials 
    expand in the basis of Schubert polynomials with nonnegative integer 
    coefficients that are precisely the structure constants of the cohomology 
    of the complex flag variety with respect to its basis of Schubert classes. 
    Lastly, we relate the construction of Bergeron and Sottile the construction 
    of Schubert polynomials in terms of rc-graphs.
