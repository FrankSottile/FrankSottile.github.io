Real Schubert calculus

Schubert's calculus was a collection of algorithms for enumerating the 
linear subspaces of a vector space having given positions with respect 
to other, fixed subspaces.   Its justification was important for the
development of modern algebraic geometry, and it has connection with 
other areas of mathematics including combinatorics and representation theory.

In this talk, I will discuss recent work which shows it is possible to 
have all solutions be real not only for these classical enumerative 
problems, but also to problems of counting rational curves on Grassmannians.
