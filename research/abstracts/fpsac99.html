<H2>The Hopf algebra of peak functions</H2>

<P>
In his work on <I>P</I>-partitions,  Stembridge defined the algebra of peak
functions PI, which is both a  
subalgebra and a retraction of the algebra of quasi-symmetric functions. We
show that PI is closed under  
coproduct, and therefore a Hopf algebra, and describe the kernel of the
retraction.
  Billey and Haiman, in  
their work on Schubert polynomials, also defined a new class of
quasi-symmetric functions --- shifted quasi-symmetric functions --- and we
show that 
PI is strictly contained in the 
linear span XI of shifted quasi-symmetric functions. We show that $\Xi$
is a coalgebra, and compute the rank of the $n$th graded component.
