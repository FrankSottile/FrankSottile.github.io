Lines Transversal to Two Lines and Tangent to a Quadric
</H2>

<P>
The picture below displays the envelope of lines
(in <FONT COLOR="#99FF99">light blue-green</font>)
which are perpendicular to the <FONT color=red>red</font> line
(and hence transversal to the <I>y-z</I> line at infinity)
and also tangent to the <FONT COLOR="#FFBB00">gold</FONT> sphere 
at the right.
The curve of tangency is drawn in <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">blue</FONT>.

<P>
We are interested in other quadrics (zeroes of quadratic polynomials) which
are also tangent to the each line in this envelope.
For example, the <FONT COLOR="#FF2244">coral</FONT> ellipsoid at the left
is tangent to every line in the envelope.
In fact, these two ellipsoids fit together into a family of ellipsoids,
each of which is tangent to every line in this family.
As members of this family approach the <FONT color=red>red</font> line,
they become increasingly cigar-shaped, eventually collapsing into the line.
(A similar phenomenon occurs at infinity.)

<P>
One may ask what other quadrics (if any) are there besides those in this
family which are tangent to every line in this envelope.
We used computer algebra to investigate this, and we found that the 
locus of quadrics tangent to this envelope is 1-dimensional,
and consists of 12 components, each a smooth rational curve.
Of these 12, 8 consist of imaginary conics, while 4 families consist of real
quadrics.

<P>
Each thumbnail sketch below illustrates one quadric in each family, together
with one of these original quadrics, for reference.
They are each linked to larger pictures.
The maple leaf below each picture links to Maple code used to draw them.
