 The necessary and sufficient Horn inequalities which determine 
 the non-vanishing 
 Littlewood-Richardson coefficients in the cohomology of a Grassmannian are
 recursive in that they are naturally indexed by non-vanishing
 Littlewood-Richardson coefficients on <i>smaller</i> Grassmannians.
 We show how 
 non-vanishing in the Schubert calculus for cominuscule flag varieties
 is similarly recursive.
 For these varieties, the non-vanishing of products of Schubert classes is
 controlled by the non-vanishing products on smaller cominuscule flag
 varieties.
 In particular, we show that the lists
 of Schubert classes whose product is non-zero 
 naturally correspond to the integer points in 
 the feasibility polytope, which is defined by inequalities 
 coming from non-vanishing products of Schubert classes on smaller
 cominuscule flag varieties.
 While the Grassmannian is cominuscule, our necessary and sufficient
 inequalities are different than the classical Horn inequalities.
