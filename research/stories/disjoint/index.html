This is an image of four disjoint spheres in <b>R</b><sup>3</sup> with 12 common tangents.
This settles a question which has been open since at least 1998  in the affirmative.
These 12 tangents have 6 geometric permutations between them.

&nbsp; &nbsp; 
The three large spheres each have radius 4/5 and are centred at the vertices of an 
equilateral triangle of side length (3)<sup>1/2</sup>.
The small sphere has radius 1/4 and is centred on the axis of symmetry of the triangle
and is located a distance 35/100 from the plane of the triangle.

Here is a maple script which draws this picture and checks these assertions.
