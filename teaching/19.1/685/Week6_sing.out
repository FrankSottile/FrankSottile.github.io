The rings R and S differ only in their monomial orderings
Let us look at R
// coefficients: QQ
// number of vars : 3
//        block   1 : ordering dp
//                  : names    x y z
//        block   2 : ordering C
Let us look at S
// coefficients: QQ
// number of vars : 3
//        block   1 : ordering lp
//                  : names    x y z
//        block   2 : ordering C
We work first in ring R, defining three polynomials in Exercise 1
Here are f, F, and G
f = x^7*y^2+x^3*y^2-y+1, F = x*y^2-x, G = -y^2+x
Notice that x*y^2 is the leading term of F  and -y^2 is the leading term of G
 x^6*F has the same leading term as f, call r = f- x^6*F
x^7+x^3*y^2-y+1
The second term, x^3*y^2, of r is divisible by the leading term of F.  We reduce it
x^7+x^3-y+1
Now there are no more divisions possible.
We have found that f = (x^6+x^2)*F + r, where r = x^7+x^3-y+1

Let us keep the same ring, but switch the order of F and G for the division.
We reduce f = x^7*y^2+x^3*y^2-y+1  with respect to G, r = f + x^7*G 
x^8+x^3*y^2-y+1
The second term, x^3*y^2, of r is divisible by G.  r = r + x^3*G 
x^8+x^4-y+1
Now there are no more divisions possible.
We have found that f = -(x^7 + x^3)*G + r, where r = x^8+x^4-y+1


The multivariate division algorithm behaves differenty if the order of F and G is reversed
Order F, G, remainder is x^7+x^3-y+1
Order G, F, remainder is x^8+x^4-y+1
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Let us set the ring to be S.
Note that we have to redefine the polynomials, as we are now in a different ring
Let us look at what the lexicographic term order does to f, F, and G. (Note the difference for G).
f = x^7*y^2+x^3*y^2-y+1, F = x*y^2-x, G = x-y^2
We have the same division as before for f and F:  r = f - x^6*F
x^7+x^3*y^2-y+1
The leading term is divisible by G and not F, r = r - x^6*G;
x^6*y^2+x^3*y^2-y+1
Now we may reduce w.r.t. F: r = r - x^5*F;
x^6+x^3*y^2-y+1
...and then G: r = r - x^5*G;
x^5*y^2+x^3*y^2-y+1
...and then F: r = r - x^4*F;
x^5+x^3*y^2-y+1
...and then G: r = r - x^4*G;
x^4*y^2+x^3*y^2-y+1
...and then F: r = r - x^3*F;
x^4+x^3*y^2-y+1
...and then G: r = r - x^3*G;
2*x^3*y^2-y+1
...and then F: r = r - 2*x^2*F;
2*x^3-y+1
...and then G: r = r - 2*x^2*G;
2*x^2*y^2-y+1
...and then F: r = r - 2*x*F;
2*x^2-y+1
...and then G: r = r - 2*x*G;
2*x*y^2-y+1
...and then F: r = r - 2*F;
2*x-y+1
...and then G: r = r - 2*G;
2*y^2-y+1
This cannot be reduced further. (It was a bit tedious)
We have found that
   f = (x^6+x^5+x^4+x^3+2*x^2+2*x+2)*F + (x^6+x^5+x^4+x^3+2*x^2+2*x+2)*G + r,
where r = 2*y^2-y+1

Let us try reductions with the order of F and G reversed.
f = x^7*y^2+x^3*y^2-y+1, F = x*y^2-x, G = x-y^2
We can reduce f using G:   r = f - x^6*y^2*G
x^6*y^4+x^3*y^2-y+1
We can reduce f using G:   r = r - x^5*y^4*G
x^5*y^6+x^3*y^2-y+1
We can reduce f using G:   r = r - x^4*y^6*G
x^4*y^8+x^3*y^2-y+1
We can reduce f using G:   r = r - x^3*y^8*G
x^3*y^10+x^3*y^2-y+1
We can reduce f using G:   r = r - x^2*y^10*G
x^3*y^2+x^2*y^12-y+1
We can reduce f using G:   r = r - x^2*y^2*G
x^2*y^12+x^2*y^4-y+1
We can reduce f using G:   r = r - x*y^12*G
x^2*y^4+x*y^14-y+1
We can reduce f using G:   r = r - x*y^4*G
x*y^14+x*y^6-y+1
We can reduce f using G:   r = r - y^14*G
x*y^6+y^16-y+1
We can reduce f using G:   r = r - y^6*G
y^16+y^8-y+1
This cannot be reduced further. (It was again, a bit tedious)
We have found that
   f = 0*F + (x^6*y^2+x^5*y^4+x^4*y^6+x^3*y^8+x^2*y^10+x^2*y^2+x*y^12+x*y^4+y^14+y^6)*G + r,
where r = y^16+y^8-y+1

Again, the multivariate division algorithm behaves differenty if the order of F and G ois reversed
Order F, G, remainder is 2*y^2-y+1
Order G, F, remainder is y^16+y^8-y+1
Auf Wiedersehen.
