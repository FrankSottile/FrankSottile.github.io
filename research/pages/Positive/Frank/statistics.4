###### Symmetric functions for graphs from chains of length 4. ######
Paritions
[c[[4]], c[[3, 1]], c[[2, 2]], c[[2, 1, 1]], c[[1, 1, 1, 1]]]
The lists in the folowing lines record the symmetric functions of the dual
 equivalence graphs.  They are pairs [i, coeffs], where i is the number of
 vertices in a graph and coeffs is the vector of Schur coefficients, where the
 order is the order of the partitions just given.
