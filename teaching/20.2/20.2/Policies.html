<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<font color=maroon> <b>Devices</b></font>: Electronic devices should only be used in class for class
 activities such as taking notes and zoom.<br>
 <font color=blue> <b>Cell Phones</b></font> are to be used only in case of emergency or for legitimate class purposes.
 Other use will elicit immediate ejection from that class period. <br>
 These policies are a relaxation of my normal rules, due to the ongoing Sars-Coronavirus 2 emergency.<br>

 To reduce the possibility of spread of viruses (corona, influenza) and to ensure a uniform testing environment
for all students, all in-class individual assessments (quizzes and exams)
 will be done electronically  <font color=red>possibly</font> in Canvas and <font color=red>likely</font> invigilated online over Zoom.
 Consequently, the following technical requirements are needed:<br>

 &nbsp; &bull;
 Appropriate hardware (laptop or desktop computer, a second device such  as a mobile phone, high-speed internet connection)<br>

 &nbsp; &bull;
   Appropriate software (PDF reader, Zoom on phone and computer, the
   latest update on an internet browser-Chrome or Firefox are recommended)


<HR>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<font color=red> <b>Exams</b></font>:
The University has not yet decided how on-line exams will be invigilated.
There are several options, including Respondus Lock Down Browser and Zoom.
I may also decide to have open book/note exams, which would make this point moot.
Consequently, I cannot be yet <font color=blue>(13 August)</font> be definitive
on this matter, nor can we expect testing polices to be uniform across all TAMU course sections.<br>

If the exams will be invigilated through Zoom, we will do the following: During each exam, you will be
required to set up a streaming video camera (cell phone or USB webcam) in
such a way that the  invigilator will be able to view your workspace during the
exam. The  invigilating sessions may be recorded. Too receive credit
for this course, you must consent to be  invigilated in this manner.<br>

Because of the extra stress that this will engender, Sottile will make the length of each of the three exams
equal to a 50-minute exam from his previous courses.
A possibility is that the exams will conducted through <a href="http://gradescope.com/">Grsadescope</a>.

<font color=red> <b>COPYRIGHT POLICY</b></font>:      All printed materials disseminated in class or on the web are protected by
    Copyright laws.  While personal use is permitted, sale of any of these

<B>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Policy Statement</B><BR>

The following ADA Policy Statement (part of the Policy on Individual Disabling
Conditions) was submitted to the University Curriculum Committee by the Department of
Student Life. The policy statement was forwarded to the Faculty Senate for information. 
<BR>
<blockquote>
<em>
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal
anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights
protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this
legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a
learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their
disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring an
accommodation, please contact the Department of Student Life, Services
for Students with Disabilities, in Room 126 of the Koldus Building or
call 845-1637.
</em>
</blockquote>

<b>Academic Integrity Statement</b> <br>

"<font color=maroon>An Aggie does not lie, cheat, or steal or tolerate those who do</font>." 
For more, see the <A HREF="https://aggiehonor.tamu.edu/Rules-and-Procedures/Rules/Honor-System-Rules">Honor Council Rules and Procedures</A>. <br> <br>

<b>Title IX and Statement on Limits to Confidentiality</b><br>

 Texas A&amp;M University and the College of Science are committed to fostering a learning environment that is safe and productive for all. 
 University policies and federal and state laws provide guidance for achieving such an environment.
 Although class materials are generally considered confidential pursuant to student record policies and laws, University employees&ndash;including
 instructors&ndash;cannot mantain confidentiality when it conflicts with their responsibility to report certain issues that jeopardize the health and safety of our
 community. 
 As the instructor, I must report (per Texas A&M System Regulation 08.01.01) the following information to other University offices if you share it with me, even if
 you do not want the disclosed information to be shared:
<ul>
  <li>Allegations of sexual assault, sexual discrimination, or sexual harassment when they involve TAMU students, faculty, or staff, or third parties visiting
     campus.</li>
</ul>
 These reports may trigger contact from a campus official who will want to talk with you about the incident that you have shared.
 In many cases, it will be your decision whether or not you wish to speak with that individual.
  If you would like to talk about these events in a more confidential setting, you are encouraged to make an appointment with the Student Counseling Service
 <a href="https://scs.tamu.edu/">(https://scs.tamu.edu/)</a>.<br>

 Students and faculty can report non-emergency behavior that causes them to be concerned at
<a href="http://tellsomebody.tamu.edu">http://tellsomebody.tamu.edu/</a>.

<br>

<b>Statement on Mental Health and Wellness</b>
<br>

Texas A&amp;M University recognizes that mental health and wellness are critical factors that influence a student's academic success and overall
wellbeing. Students are encouraged to engage in proper self-care by utilizing the resources and services available from
Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (CAPS). Students who need someone to talk to can
call the TAMU Helpline (979-845-2700) from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. weekdays and 24 hours on
weekends. 24-hour emergency help is also available through the National Suicide Prevention
Hotline (800-273-8255) or at <a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/">suicidepreventionlifeline.org</a>.

<b>COVID-19 Temporary Amendment to Minimum Syllabus Requirements</b>
<br>
<b>Campus Safety Measures</b>
<br>
To promote public safety and protect students, faculty, and staff during the coronavirus pandemic, Texas A&M University has adopted policies and practices for
the Fall 2020 academic term to limit virus transmission. Students must observe the following practices while participating in face-to-face courses and
course-related activities (office hours, help sessions, transitioning to and between classes, study spaces, academic services, etc.): 

<ul>
  <li><b>Self-monitoring</b>
   Students should follow CDC recommendations for self-monitoring. Students who have a fever or exhibit symptoms of COVID-19 should participate in class
  remotely and should not participate in face-to-face instruction.
  </li>
  <li> <b>Face Coverings</b>
 
 Face coverings (cloth face covering, surgical mask, etc.) must be properly worn in all non-private spaces including classrooms, teaching laboratories,
  common spaces such as lobbies and hallways, public study spaces, libraries, academic resource and support offices, and outdoor spaces where 6 feet of physical
  distancing is difficult to reliably maintain. Description of face coverings and additional guidance are provided in the
  <a href="https://rules-saps.tamu.edu/PDFs/34.99.99.M0.03.pdf">Face Covering policy</a> and
  <a href="https://provost.tamu.edu/Menu/News/TAMU-Face-Covering-FAQs">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</a> available on the Provost website.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Physical Distancing</b>
  Physical distancing must be maintained between students, instructors, and others in course and course-related activities.
  </li>
  <li><b>Classroom Ingress/Egress</b> Students must follow marked pathways for entering and exiting classrooms and other teaching spaces. Leave classrooms
  promptly after course activities have concluded. Do not congregate in hallways and maintain 1 metre physical distancing when waiting to enter classrooms and
  other instructional spaces. 
  </li>
  <li>To attend this face-to-face class, students must wear a face covering (or a face shield if they have an exemption letter).
  If a student refuses to wear a face covering, the instructor will ask the student to leave and join the class remotely.
  If the student does not leave the class, Sottile that student to the
  <a href="https://studentlife.tamu.edu/sco/face-covering-violations/">Student Conduct office</a> for sanction, and
  will teach the remainder of that day's class remotely for all students.
  </li>



</ul>

<b>Personal Illness and Quarantine</b><br>

Students required to quarantine must participate in courses and course-related activities remotely and <font color=maroon>must not attend face-to-face course
activities</font>.
Students should notify their instructors of the quarantine requirement.
Students under quarantine are expected to participate in courses and complete graded work unless they have symptoms that are too severe to participate in
course activities. <br>


Students experiencing personal injury or Illness that is too severe for the student to attend class qualify for an excused absence
(See Student Rule 7, Section 7.2.2.)
To receive an excused absence, students must comply with the documentation and notification guidelines outlined in
Student Rule 7. While Student Rule 7, Section 7.3.2.1, indicates a medical confirmation note from the student's medical provider is preferred, for Fall 2020
only, students may use the Explanatory Statement for Absence from Class form in lieu of a medical confirmation.
Students must submit the Explanatory Statement for Absence from Class within two business days after the last date of absence.
As already indicated, Sottile will be very lenient in these circumstances.
