The subject of real algebraic plane curves began in 1876, when Harnack proved
that a smooth real plane curve of degree <i>d</I> can have at most 
1 + (<i>d</I>-1)(<i>d</I>-2)/2 ovals, and then he constructed plane curves of
any degree achieving this bound.
Harnack's inductive construction is very elegant and straightforward.

Much work was done on finding prohibitions as well as new constructions in the
ensuing 100 years.
A breakthrough with important consequences for other fields was achieved by
Viro around 1980 with his construction of <i>T</I>-curves based upon what are
now called toric deformations.
