<H2>5.ii. Further remarks</H2>

While the <A HREF="SectV.1.html">counterexample</A> of the previous section
shows that we cannot guarantee all points of 
intersection real in a general flag variety when the Schubert varieties are
given by flags osculating 
a real rational normal curve, a number of questions remain (besides the
resolution of the conjectures of the previous sections).
There remains the original question of Fulton.
<P>

<B>Question 1:</B>
Given Schubert data for a flag manifold, do there exist real flags in general
position whose corresponding Schubert varieties have <I>only</I> real points
of intersection? 
<P>

In every case we know, this does happen.
For instance, in the <A HREF="SectV.1.html">counterexample</A> of the
previous section, if the 3-plane <I>B</I> osculates the rational
normal curve at 2 (and the others remain fixed), then all 4 solution flags
are real.  
There is also the following result, showing this holds in infinitely many
cases.
A <I>Grassmannian Schubert condition</I> is a Schubert condition on flags
which only imposes conditions on one of the subspaces. 
We likewise define Grassmannian Schubert data.
For example,  the <A HREF="SectV.1.html">Counterexample</A>  involves 
Grassmannian Schubert data.
Let <B>F</B>(2,<I>n</I>-2;<I>n</I>) be the manifold of two-step flags 
consisting of a 2-planes <I>X</I> contained in a 
(<I>n</I>-2)-plane <I>Y</I> in <B>C</B><SUP>n</SUP>.
<P>

<B>Proposition 1.</B> (Theorem 13 of 
[<A HREF="Bib.html#So97b">So97b</A>])
<I>
Given any Grassmannian Schubert data for 
<B>F</B>(2,<I>n</I>-2;<I>n</I>),
there exist real flags whose corresponding Schubert varieties meet
transversally with all points of intersection real.
</I>

<P>
The beauty of the conjectures of Shapiro and Shapiro is that they give a
simple algorithm for selecting the flags defining the Schubert varieties.
<P>


<B>Question 2:</B>
Can the choice of flags in Question 1 (or even Proposition 1)
be made effective?
In particular, is there an algorithm for selecting these flags?
<P>

Also, the cases we were able to prove of Shapiros' conjecture relied upon
our ability to show that certain discriminants were sums of squares.
Is this always the case?
<P>

<B>Question 3:</B>
Are the discriminants of polynomial systems arising from Conjectures
<A HREF="SectII.2.html">1</A>  and <A HREF="SectIII.2.html">2</A>
always sums of squares?

<P>

We only used that these were sums of squares to show that there were no
points where the corresponding polynomial systems had multiple solutions.
Is this always the case?
<P>

<B>Question 4:</B>
Do the choices of flags defining Schubert conditions in these conjectures of
Shapiro (osculating at distinct real points for  Conjectures
<A HREF="SectII.2.html">1</A>  and <A HREF="SectIII.2.html">2</A>
<!-- , and ordered for <A HREF="SectIV.1.html">Conjecture 3</A>)-->
<!--  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  This is false   -->
always give non-degenerate systems with no multiple solutions (points of
intersection)?
