We study when a problem in enumerative geometry may have all of its
solutions be real and show that many Schubert-type enumerative problems on
some flag manifolds can have all of their solutions real. Our particular
focus is to find how to use the knowledge that one problem can have all its
solutions to be real to deduce that other, related problems do as well. The
primary technique is to study deformations of intersections of subvarieties
into simple cycles. These methods may also be used to give lower bounds on
the number of real solutions that are possible for a given enumerative
problem.<br>
