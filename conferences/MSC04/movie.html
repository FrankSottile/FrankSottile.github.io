    This animation illustrates the conjecture of Boris Shapiro and Michael
    Shapiro, in the case of the classical problem of the two lines meeting
    four lines in space.
   <P>
    In this case, their conjecture states that, if we have four lines tangent to
    the <font color=blue>rational normal curve</font> 
    (in <font color=blue>blue</font>) at real points, then there are exactly two
    lines meeting them, and both lines are real.
    Indeed, given three such lines (shown in <font color=red>red</font>, 
    <font color="00AA00">green</font>, and <font color=magenta>magenta</font>), 
    there is a unique doubly-ruled quadric through these three lines (here a 
    <font color=gold>yellow hyperboloid</font> of one sheet).
    One ruling contains the three lines, and the other consists of the lines
    meeting the three.
   <P>
    The animation shows a <font color=brown>tangent line</font> whose 
    <font color=blue>point of tangency</font> moves.
    As you can see, every such <font color=brown>tangent line</font> meets the 
    <font color="FFEE00"> hyperboloid</font> in two points, each corresponding to 
    a real line meeting the first three tangent lines.
