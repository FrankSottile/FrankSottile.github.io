<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   Convex subsets in <b>R</b><sup><i>d</i></sup> play an important role in Discrete and
Computational Geometry.  A cornerstone of the theory of convexity is
Helly's Theorem from 1923 which states that if there is a point in
common to every <i>d</i>+1 (or fewer) members of a finite collection of
convex sets in <b>R</b><sup><i>d</i></sup>, then the whole family has a point in common. The
usefulness of such a basic numerical result led to a search for
similar results for other objects besides points, for example line
transversals to convex sets in <b>R</b><sup><i>d</i></sup>.  While that is impossible in
general, in 1940 Santalo proved a Helly-type result for line
transversals to boxes in <b>R</b><sup><i>d</i></sup>.

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; 
   This talk will describe these foundational results in Convex
Geometry and discuss how an analysis of Santalo's arguments leads
to a new and very pleasing convexity structure on ascending lines in
<b>R</b><sup><i>d</i></sup>, one that is related to some interesting geometry of the
Grassmannian of lines.  For example, the two pictures above are
the convex hull of two lines in <b>R</b><sup>3</sup> (on the left) and the convex
hull of three lines (on the right).
