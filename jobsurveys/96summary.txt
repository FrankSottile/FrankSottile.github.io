                   Summary of 1996 YMN Job Survey
                            Frank Sottile

In May, we asked our readers to share with us their experiences on the
job market this year.  We received 77 applicable responses.  Here, I
have tried to compile some of the data gleaned from those responses,
which may be compared to an article in issue ???? of Concerns.


The following chart compares applicant's previous position (horizontal)
versus situation next year (vertical).  These categories are what the
applicants indicated about their positions.  

tt := tenure track, temp := temporary, including postdoctoral positions,
part := part time, grad := graduate student, ps := private sector & gov,
nj := no job at the time of survey.

        tt  temp   grad   ps   part    total

tt           10a    12                   22
temp          8     15                   23
part          1                  1        2
ps            1      4     2              7
nj      4b   11c     8                   23

total   4    31     39     2     1       77

a : Includes one who left a research post doc for community college 
b : Three who were trying (unsuccessfully) to change jobs, and one who
		resigned their position.
c : Includes two whose position continues next year

Of those without tenure track jobs,

7  Have three year positions.
4  Have two year positions.
6  Have one year positions
2  Have part time positions.
8  are not clear from the response.


The next chart is a histogram with frequency plotted horizontally.

Date of initial job offer by type of employment.  

X:= Tenure track position, 
O := temporary position (including postdoctoral and part time), 
I := Non-academic employment

A few things to note about this information:

Most of the people who sent out fewer than 40 applications were not
conducting `traditional' job searches : 
Either they already had positions for next year and were wither trying
to change their jobs, or they were `testing the waters', or they were
trying to solve a two-body problem.

Some successful job seekers who sent out few appplications attributed
their success to having carefully selected where to send their
applications and carefully tailoring each application.


What strikes me the most about this survey is that, of academic job
seekers 23 out of 70, which is 33%, were unsuccessful.   Since at least
five have positions for next year already, that means that the rate of 
unemployment is at most 25%.   How comforting.

I suppose that we can draw the conclusion that the academic job market
still stinks, and that it probably has not changed since last year.
The YMN survey last year had 17 without jobs out of 72, or 24%.
