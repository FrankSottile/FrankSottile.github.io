<H2>2.v. Equivalent systems</H2>

The conjecture of Shapiro and Shapiro 
(<B><A HREF="SectII.2.html#conj">Conjecture 1</A></B>) concerns a very
specific polynomial  <I>f(s)</I>:

</TABLE>
There are a number of equivalent polynomial systems, including those with
fewer indeterminants.
To see this, we appeal to geometry.
<P>

&#160;&#160;
First, our choice of <I>F</I> as local coordinates for the Grassmannian is
not canonical, and any other choice will give an equivalent system of
polynomials.
We caution that  for some choices of the parameters
<I>s<SUB>1</SUB>, s<SUB>2</SUB>, ..., s<SUB>mp</SUB></I>, there may be 
solutions that do not lie in the chosen coordinate patch.
<P>

&#160;&#160;
More interesting is the matrix <I>K(s)</I>.
The first row consists of all monomials of degree less than <I>m+p</I>,
and subsequent rows are derivatives of the first.
The first row is a parameterization of a rational normal curve in 
<B>C</B><SUP><I>m+p</I></SUP>, and so it follows that <I>K(s)</I> is the
<I>m</I>-plane osculating this curve.
Since all parameterized rational normal curves are projectively equivalent,
we are free to replace <I>K(s)</I> in the definition of <I>f(s)</I> above 
by <I>any</I> <I>m</I>-plane osculating a parameterized real rational normal
curve.
(This is equivalent to choosing different local coordinates for the
Grassmannian.)
<P>

&#160;&#160;
Reparameterizing the original rational normal curve, we may assume that up
to 3 of the <I>s<SUB>i</SUB></I> are any fixed points on the projective line.
It is most useful to fix one to be 0 and one to be the point at infinity.
Doing so, we may reduce the parameters by 2, and choose local coordinates
for the set of <I>p</I>-planes <I>H</I> which meet the <I>m</I>-plane 
osculating at 0 and infinity.
For details on the selection, see Section 2.5 of "Real Schubert Calculus:
Polynomial systems and a conjecture of Shapiro and Shapiro".
We have a Maple script that will <A HREF="computations/Loc_Coords.maple">
generate</A> local coordinates.
