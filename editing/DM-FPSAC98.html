This volume contains papers presented at the 10th Conference "Formal Power Series
and Algebraic Combinatorics", held at the
Fields Institute in Toronto, Canada, from June 15 to June 19, 1998.
The purpose of this series of conferences is to explore the interplay between
combinatorics, algebra and computer science, and the relations of these
fields with
other branches of science. In particular, the topics discussed in this
volume include
problems in  enumerative combinatorics, formal power series, word problems
in monoids,
combinatorics of symmetric functions, homology, and  regular graphs.

<P>
We would like to thank the members of the program committee and the other
referees
who contributed to the elaboration of this volume. We address our thanks to our
sponsors, the Fields Institute, the
centre de recherche math&eacute;matiques in Montreal,
the Connaught fund of the University of Toronto and York University,
and also to the speakers and the participants for their contribution to the
success of
the conference.
