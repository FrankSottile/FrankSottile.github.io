 We characterize the orientability of an abstract real toric variety as well as  the
 orientability of a toric subvariety of a sphere.
 We also determine the number of components of the smooth locus of a toric variety.
 These results are proven for an extension of the Davis-Januskiewicz notion of a small
 cover to singular spaces.
 We characterize the orientability of toric varieties associated to posets,
 and discuss an application to the study of real solutions to systems of polynomial
 equations.
