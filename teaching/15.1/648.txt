Computational Algebraic Geometry
Math 648
Frank Sottile
Winter 2015

   This course will cover the basics of computational algebraic geometry,
including the core algorithms in the subject, as well as introduce
some of the most common algebraic varieties which occur in applications.
We will gain familiarity with software for algebraic geometry, including
the systems Macaulay 2, Singular, and Bertini.   Students will complete 
a final project in the subject which will be presented to the class
in lieu of a final exam.   Grading will be based on final projects and
some written/computer work through the term.

I expect to cover the following topics:

 - Algebraic-Geometric Dictionary
 - Groebner bases, including algorithms based on Groebner bases
 - Resultants and elimination
 - Solving polynomial systems symbolically.      
 - Some structural properties of algebraic varieties
 - Real root counting.  Sturm's theorem.  Fewnomial theory
 - Solving systems of polynomial equations using 
    numerical continuation
 - Certification of numerical solutions.  Smale's \alpha-theory    
 - Numerical algebraic geometry.  Witness sets and numerical 
     irreducible decomposition
 - Toric ideals
 - Toric varieties and Khovanskii bases

Time permitting, we will cover additional topics, with a focus on 
 numerical methods.
