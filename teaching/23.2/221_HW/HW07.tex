\begin{enumerate}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Find and classify all the critical points in the domains of the following functions.

  (a)\ $2x^2 + 2xy + y^2 +2x + 2y\,.$  \qquad
  (b)\  $xy+\frac{2}{x} + \frac{3}{y}\,.$  \qquad
  (c)\ $x^3+y^3-6xy\,.$

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Suppose that $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2+kxy$.
  Find and classify its critical points, and discuss how they change when $k$ takes on different values.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item  Find the absolute maximum and minimum points of the function $f(x,y)=x^3+3y-3xy$ over the region bounded by $y=x$, $y=0$, and $x=2$. 
\vspace{-2pt}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

   
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item  Find the absolute maximum and minimum points of the function $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2+x^2y+4$ over the square
  $\{(x,y)\in\RR^2\mid -1\leq x,y\leq 1\}$.

\item \begin{minipage}[t]{340pt}
  A length of metal sheet 2 meters wide is to be made into a trough by bending up equal strips along both sides.
  Find the width, $x$, of the strip of metal to be bent and the angle $\phi$, so that the trough has maximum cross-sectional area.

\item Find the points on the surface $xy-z^2+1=0$ that are closest to the origin.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Find the volume of the largest box with edges parallel to the coordinate axes that may be inscribed in the ellipsoid
  $8x^2 + 9 y^2 + 4 z^2=72$.
\vspace{-2pt}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Let $a,b,c$ be positive numbers.
  Find the  volume of the largest box in the positive octant  with three faces lying in the coordinate planes and one vertex on the plane
  $x/a+y/b+z/c=1$.    
\vspace{-2pt}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Consider the function $f(x,y)=x^3-3x^2y+y^3$.
  Show that $(0,0)$ is the only critical point of $f$, and that the discriminant test is inconclusive for $f$.

  Determine the cross-sections of $f$ obtained by considering the lines through the origin (e.g. set $y=kx$ for different values of $k$).

  What type of critical point for $f$ is the point $(0,0)$ ?
\vspace{-2pt}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item At which point $(x,y)$ is the sum of the squares of the distance to the three points $(1,4)$, $(5,2)$, and $(3,2)$ minimized?

  What is the distance from this point $(x,y)$ to each of the three points?
