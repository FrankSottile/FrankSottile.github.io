In late May, a survey on the job market was published in the Concerns,
and responses were solicited.  A total of 78 responses were received.
Here, I have tried to compile some of the statistics from those responses.
While this is a small (less that 5%) sample, and is not random by any means,
there are some interesting pieces of information that can be gleaned from
the data.


The following chart compares applicant's present position (horizontal)
versus situation next year (vertical).  These categories are what the 
applicants indicated about their positions.   
tt := tenure track, pd := post doctoral,  temp := temporary positions,
part := part time,  grad := graduate student,  ps := private sector,  
nj := no job at the time of survey.

       tt    pd   temp  part  grad  ps   nj   total

tt      3     7    9*          13               32
pd            2          1*     9               12
temp          3    2     1      3                9
part          1                 1                2
ps                 1            1         1      3
nj            2    4*    2      8   3**   1     20

total   3    15   16     4     35   3     2     78

*  := These applicants were tryiing to solve a two-body problem.
** := These applicants were trying to change jobs.

Of those without tenure track jobs,

12   Have two year positions.
8    Have one year positions
2    Have part time positions.
1    is not clear from the response.
12   have postdoctoral positions



The next 2 charts are histograms with frequency plotted horizontally.


Date of initial job offer by type of employment.  X:= Tenure track position, 
O := temporary position (including postdoctoral and part time), 
I := Non-academic employment

         0    5    10   15   20
January   XOO
February  XXXOOOOI
March     XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXOOOOOOI
April     XXXXXXXOOOOOI
May       XXXOOOO 

Two respondents with temporary job offers did not indicate when they 
received their offers.

Since the survey took place during May, the numbers from May should be 
adjusted upwards before comparing with the other months.

For both March and April, I have further indicated which half of the month
thte offers came.  (This is only approximate, as not every response gave 
an exact date of offer)

              0    5    10   15   20
March 1-14     XXXXXXXXXXXXOO
March 15-31    XXXXXXOOOOI
April 1-14     XXXXOOO
April 15-30    XXXOOI

A few things to note about this information:

Of the six people who sent out ten or fewer applications,
 3  Were trying to solve a two-body problem (with 66% success)
 2  Were graduate students who were "testing the water" prior to 
    graduation and hooked tasty postdocs
 2  Were trying to move from one tenure track position to another and 
    only applied to the position they received.

In addition, many of the successful applicants who sent out few appplications
attributed their success to having carefully selected where to send their 
applications and then tailoring each to the specific position it was for.

Casually perusing this chart, one is struck by the lack of a correlation 
between numer of applications sent and job success.  This may be because
applicants correctly guage their chances of success and send out 
'right' number of applications to ensure an average rate of success.
An Economist might note that, as a means of transmitting information
about the market, the market works efficiently.    There may, however, be 
other valid interpretations of these data.


[I wish to apologize for the publication delay of this summary; I have not
had adequate Internet access for the past seven weeks.   In late August,
the third article from the job survey will appear; it will feature
comments that were included among the resposes.  I want to thank those 
who took the trouble to respond to the survey.]
