<font color=maroon><h2>The term paper (due Sunday, December 9 2018) </h2></font>
  You will need to both email a .pdf to me at <TT><a href="mailto:fjsteachmath@gmail.com">fjsteachmath@gmail.com</a></TT>,
  and submit this to turnitin.com.<br>
  The information for our class will be coming:<!--<br>
  <font color=magenta>Math 629 History of Mathematics &nbsp; &nbsp; Class ID: 17442478 &nbsp; &nbsp; Class Password: Sottile629</font>-->
<hr>
 The paper should be fully referenced and any reasonable style of referencing is acceptable.
 It should be 12 point (the easier for me to read) double (actually about 1.37 to 1.5)
 spaced, so that I may write comments between the lines.
 Also, please have a running head with your name on each page and page numbers.
 The term paper should be a thoughtful discussion of your paradox including the appropriate mathematics and history. 
 A superficial discussion is not sufficient.
 I want to know by reading the paper that you learned some things and thought seriously about the paradox.
The paper should be at least 3000 words long (this is shorter than Dr. Geller asked for).
<br><br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;
There are 5 students in the class this fall, and 13 paradoxes listed.
At most one student per paradox.
Please pick one and tell me,  first come, first served.
Acceptable paradoxes with some description of them may be found in chapter 13 of the course book (not the readings).
A list of them along with who has taken them can be found here.
Feel free to suggest others, but they must be approved.
