This paper builds on work by Joni and Rota, Schmitt, and
Ehrenborg. Hopf algebras give a global algebraic framework for
studying partially ordered sets; Ehrenborg defined, for each graded
partially ordered set, a quasi-symmetric function, which induces a
Hopf morphism from the Hopf algebra of graded posets to the Hopf
algebra of quasi-symmetric functions.
<P>
The main theorem in this paper is quite rich in applications (not
fully exploited here, but rather in a forthcoming paper by the same
authors). In order to state it, we outline some definitions. A graded
poset $p$ is defined in the paper, along with a function $f\sb J(p)$ that
has as output the maximal chains in $p$ with descent set contained in
$J$. The algebra $Q\sb \bullet$ of quasi-symmetric functions consists of
all formal power series of bounded degree in commuting indeterminates
$x\sb 1,x\sb 2,\cdots $ in which the coefficient of
$x\sb {i\sb 1}\sp {\alpha\sb 1}x\sb {i\sb 2}\sp {\alpha\sb 2}\cdots x\sb {i\sb
k}\sp {\alpha\sb k}$
depends only on $\alpha$ and not on $i\sb 1,\cdots ,i\sb k$ if
$i\sb 1&lt;i\sb 2&lt;\cdots&lt;i\sb k$. $Q\sb \bullet$ has a basis of monomial
quasi-symmetric functions $M\sb \alpha$. The main object of study here is
the function $F\sb p=\sum\sb {\alpha}f\sb {i(\alpha)}(p)M\sb \alpha$. Let $P$
be a
class of graded posets closed under taking subintevals and
products. The incidence coalgebra $IP$ of $P$ is the graded free
abelian group generated by isomorphism classes of posets in $P$ with
grading induced by the rank of a poset and coproduct by
$\Delta(p)=\sum\sb {x\in p}[\widehat{0},x]\otimes[x,\widehat{1}].$ An
algebra structure on $IP$ is defined.
<P>
The main theorem in this paper states that if $P$ is a class of
edge-labeled posets closed under subintervals and products, then the
map $\Phi\colon IP\rightarrow Q\sb \bullet$ induced by $p\in P\rightarrow
F\sb {p}\in Q\sb \bullet$ is a morphism of graded Hopf algebras. A short
example using the Boolean poset follows the theorem.
<P>
The last two sections apply some of the previous results to
rank-selected posets and symmetric edge-labeled posets.<P><P>
