   In 1981, Brockett and Byrnes showed how the static feedback laws which
control a given linear system are determined through the Schubert calculus
of enumerative geometry.  This talk will describe that connection and
propose numerical homotopy methods to solve the resulting systems of
polynomials.

<P>
  The related questions of finding real feedback laws and of
trying to do Schubert's calculus over the real numbers are intertwined with
a precise conjecture of Shapiro and Shapiro.  We discuss this connection and
present some impressive computational evidence in support of this
conjecture.  We close with a new result, proving a version of this conjecture
and showing it is possible to do Schubert's calculus over the real numbers.
