<P>
Hilbert proved that a non-negative real quartic form 
<i>f</I>(<I>x</i>,<i>y</i>,<I>z</i>) is
the sum of three squares of quadratic forms. We give a new proof
which shows that if the plane curve <I>Q</I> defined by <I>f</I> is
non-singular, then <i>f</I> has exactly 8 such representations, up to
equivalence. They correspond to those real 2-torsion points of the
Jacobian of the <I>Q</I> which are not represented by a
conjugation-invariant divisor on <I>Q</I>.
