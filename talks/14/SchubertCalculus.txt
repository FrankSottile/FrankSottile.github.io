What is Schubert Calculus ?
Frank Sottile


The Schubert calculus is concerned with all geometric 
problems that involve determining the linear subspaces 
of a vector space that have given positions with respect
to other fixed, but general, linear subspaces.   While on 
its face this seems to be a topic in linear algebra, such 
problems are highly non-linear and combinatorial in nature.

Today I will give you an idea of some geometric and 
combinatorial aspects of Schubert calculus while developing 
enough techniques to answer some simple, but non-trivial 
problems from the Schubert calculus.
