<H2>A Sagbi Basis for the Quantum Grassmannian</H2>

Frank Sottile and Bernd Sturmfels

<P>
The maximal minors of a <I>p</I> by (<I>m</I>+<I>p</I>)-matrix of univariate
polynomials of degree <I>n</I> with indeterminate coefficients
are themselves polynomials of degree <I>np</I>.
The subalgebra generated by their coefficients is
the coordinate ring of the quantum Grassmannian,
a singular compactification of the space of rational curves 
of degree <I>np</I> in the Grassmannian of <I>p</I>-planes in 
(<I>m</I>+<I>p</I>)-space.
These subalgebra generators  are shown to form a sagbi basis.
The resulting flat deformation from the quantum Grassmannian  
to a toric variety gives a new "Gr&ouml;bner basis style" proof of
the Ravi-Rosenthal-Wang formulas  in quantum Schubert calculus.
The coordinate ring of the quantum Grassmannian is an
algebra with straightening law, which is normal,
Cohen-Macaulay, Gorenstein and Koszul, 
and the ideal of quantum Pl&uuml;cker relations has a 
quadratic Gr&ouml;bner basis.  This holds more
generally for skew quantum Schubert varieties. These results 
are well-known for the classical Schubert varieties (<I>n</I>=0).
We also show that the row-consecutive <I>p</I> by <I>p</I>-minors of
a generic matrix form a sagbi basis
and we give a quadratic Gr&ouml;bner basis for their algebraic relations.
