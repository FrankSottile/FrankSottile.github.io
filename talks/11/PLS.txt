The phase limit set of a variety

-Frank Sottie

 A complex coamoeba is the image of a subvariety of 
a complex torus under the argument map to the real 
torus.   Coamoebae exhibit structure that is both 
polyhdral and curvilinear.  We describe the structure 
of the boundary of the coamoeba of a variety, which 
we relate to its logarithmic limit set.   Detailed 
examples of lines in three-dimensional space illustrate 
and motivate these results.  This is joint work with 
Mounir Nisse.
