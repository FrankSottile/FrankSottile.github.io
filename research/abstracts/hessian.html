     <p>
 We give some real algebraic plane curves whose hessians have more connected
 components than had been known previously.
 In particular, we give a quartic whose hessian has 4 compact connected
 components (ovals), a quintic whose Hessian has 8 ovals, and a sextic with 11
 ovals and 2 unbounded components.
 We discuss the possible configurations of ovals of hessian curves and of
 parabolic curves for surfaces arising as graphs of polynomials.
