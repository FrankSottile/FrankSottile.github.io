\noindent {\color{Maroon}\bf Definition:}  Let $a$, $b$, and $m$ be integers.
We say that $a$ and $b$ are \demph{congruent modulo $m$} if $m$ divides their difference, $a-b$.
That is, when $m|(a-b)$.
We write \defcolor{$a\equiv b\mod m$} when this occurs.

\noindent {\color{Maroon}\bf Definition:}
A real number $x$ is a \demph{rational number} when there exists integers $n,d$ with $d\neq 0$ such that  $x=n/d$.
  A real number that is not rational is an \demph{irrational number}.


\noindent {\color{Maroon}\bf Definition:}
Suppose that $a$ is a nonnegative real number.
The \demph{square root of $a$} is the unique nonnegative real number $r$ such that $r^2=a$.
We write \demph{$\sqrt{a}$} for the square root of $a$.

\begin{enumerate}  %  the \begin{..}  \end{..} stars and ends an environment.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item In our text (but not lectures), when we discuss congruence modulo a natural number $m$, we require that $m>1$.
  Let us explore what happens in some extreme cases.
  Your answers need not be more than a few sentences long, and do not need a proof, but should show understanding.
  
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Discuss what happens when $m=1$ in the above definition for congruence modulo $m$.
        That is: what are its consequences, which numbers are congruent to others, and etc.

  \item How about when $m=0$?   What are its consequences, etc.?


  \item If we replace $m$ by $-m$ in the definition, what changes?

  \end{enumerate}    
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Let $a$ be an integer.   Prove or find a counterexample to the statement that if $a$ is odd, then $a^2 \equiv 1 \mod 8$.
      (Recall that we proved in class that $4|(a^2-1)$.)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Write up a nice, clean proof of the arithmetic-geometric mean: \ 
  ``For all positive real numbers $x$ and $y$,  we have $\sqrt{xy}\leq \frac{x+y}{2}$, and we have equality if and only if $x=y$.''
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Let $x$ be a positive real number.
  Prove that $x+\frac{1}{x} \geq 2$.

  Hint: There is an easy way to do this and a hard way to do this.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Prove for every three real numbers $x$, $y$ and $z$ that $|x - z| \leq |x - y| + |y - z|$. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Prove that for all real numbers $a,b,c,d$, we have $(ac+bd)^2\leq (a^2+b^2)(c^2+d^2)$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item 
  Is the following statement true or false? (If true, give a proof, if false, give a counterexample.)\newline
  ``For each positive real number $x$, if $x$ is irrational, then $\sqrt{x}$ is irrational.''
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Let $A$ and $B$ be sets. Prove that $A\cup B = (A - B) \cup (B - A) \cup (A \cap B)$.
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item In the context of the previous problem, under what conditions do those three sets form a partition
  (See Section 1.5 of our text) of $A\cup B$?
  Prove your assertion.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item Prove that if $A$ and $B$ are sets such that $A\cup B\neq\emptyset$, then $A\neq\emptyset$ or $B\neq\emptyset$.
